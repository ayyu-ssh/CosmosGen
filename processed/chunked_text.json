There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them . . . Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate . . . Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all. Seneca, Natural Questions, Book 7, first century In ancient times, in everyday speech and custom, the most mundane happenings were connected with the grandest cosmic events. A charming example is an incantation against the worm which the Assyrians of 1000 B.C. imagined to cause toothaches.",
    "chunk_3": "It begins with the origin of the universe and ends with a cure for toothache After Anu had created the heaven, And the heaven had created the earth, And the earth had created the rivers, And the rivers had created the canals, And the canals had created the morass, And the morass had created the worm, The worm went before Shamash, weeping, His tears flowing before Ea What wilt thou give me for my food, What wilt thou give me for my drink? I will give thee the dried fig And the apricot. What are these to me? The dried fig And the apricot! Lift me up, and among the teeth And the gums let me dwell!... Because thou hast said this, O worm, May Ea smite thee with the might of His hand! Incantation against toothache. Its treatment Second grade beer . . .",
    "chunk_4": "and oil thou shalt mix together The incantation thou shalt recite three times thereon and shalt put the medicine upon the tooth. xii  Introduction Our ancestors were eager to understand the world but had not quite stumbled upon the method. They imagined a small, quaint, tidy universe in which the dominant forces were gods like Anu, Ea, and Shamash. In that universe humans played an important if not a central role. We were intimately bound up with the rest of nature. The treatment of toothache with second rate beer was tied to the deepest cosmological mysteries. Today we have discovered a powerful and elegant way to understand the universe, a method called science it has revealed to us a universe so ancient and so vast that human affairs seem at first sight to be of little consequence. We have grown distant from the Cosmos.",
    "chunk_5": "It has seemed remote and irrelevant to everyday concerns. But science has found not only that the universe has a reeling and ecstatic grandeur, not only that it is accessible to human understanding, but also that we are, in a very real and prof ound sense, a part of that Cosmos, born from it, our fate deeply connected with it. The most basic human events and the most trivial trace back to the universe and its origins. This book is devoted to the exploration of that cosmic perspective. In the summer and fall of 1976, as a member of the Viking Lander Imaging Flight Team, I was engaged, with a hundred of my scientific colleagues, in the exploration of the planet Mars. For the first time in human history we had landed two space vehicles on the surface of another world.",
    "chunk_6": "The results, described more fully in Chapter 5, were spectacular, the historical significance of the mission utterly apparent. And yet the general public was learning almost nothing of these great happenings. The press was largely inattentive television ignored the mission almo st altogether. When it became clear that a definitive answer on whether there is life on Mars would not be forthcoming, interest dwindled still further. There was little tolerance for ambiguity. When we found the sky of Mars to be a kind of pinkish yellow rather than the blue which had erroneously first been reported, the announcement was greeted by a chorus of good natured boos from the assembled reporters they wanted Mars to be, even in this respect, like the Earth. They believed that their audiences woul d be progressively disinterested as Mars was revealed to be less and less like the Earth.",
    "chunk_7": "And yet the Martian landscapes are staggering, the vistas breathtaking. I was positive from my own experience that an enormous global interest exists in the exploration of the planets and in many kindred scientific topics the origin of life, the Earth, and the Cosmos, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, our connection with the universe. And I was certain that this interest could be excited through that most powerful communications medium, television. My feelings were shared by B. Gentry Lee, the Viking Data Analysis and Mission Planning Director, a man of extraordinary organizational abilities. We decided, gamely, to do something about the problem ourselves. Lee proposed that we form a Introduction  xiii production company devoted to the communication of science in an engaging and accessible way. In the following months we were approached on a number of projects.",
    "chunk_8": "But by far the most interesting was an inquiry tendered by KCET, the Public Broadcasting Servi ces outlet in Los Angeles. Eventually, we jointly agreed to produce a thirteen part television series oriented toward astronomy but with a very broad human perspective. It was to be aimed at popular audiences, to be visually and musically stunning, and to engage the heart as well as the mind. We talked with underwriters, hired an executive producer, and found ourselves embarked on a three year project called Cosmos . At this writing it has an estimated worldwide viewing audience of 140 million people, or 3 percent of the human population of the planet Earth.",
    "chunk_9": "It is dedicated to the proposition that the public is far more intelligent than it has generally been given cr edit for that the deepest scientific questions on the nature and origin of the world excite the interests and passions of enormous numbers of people. The present epoch is a major crossroads for our civilization and perhaps for our species. Whatever road w e take, our fate is indissolubly bound up with science. It is essential as a matter of simple survival for us to understand science. In addition, science is a delight evolution has arranged that we take pleasure in understanding those who understand are m ore likely to survive. The Cosmos television series and this book represent a hopeful experiment in communicating some of the ideas, methods and joys of science. The book and the television series evolved together. In some sense each is based on the other.",
    "chunk_10": "Many illustrations in this book are based on the striking visuals prepared for the television series. But books and television series have somewhat different aud iences and admit differing approaches. One of the great virtues of a book is that it is possible for the reader to return repeatedly to obscure or difficult passages this is only beginning to become possible, with the development of videotape and video disc technology, for television. There is much more freedom for the author in choosing the range and depth of topics for a chapter in a book than for the procrustean fifty  eight minutes, thirty seconds of a noncommercial television program. This book goes mo re deeply into many topics than does the television series. There are topics discussed in the book which are not treated in the television series and vice versa.",
    "chunk_11": "The sequence of drawings, after Tenniel, of Alice and her friends in high  and low gravity environments were uncertain, at this writing, to survive the rigors of television editing. I am delighted that these charming illustrations by the artist, Brown, and the accompanying discussion have found a home here. On the other hand, explicit representations of the Cosmic Calendar, featured in the television series, do not appear here in part because the Cosmic Calendar is discussed in my book The Dragons of Eden  likewise, I do not xiv  Introduction here discuss the life of Robert Goddard in much detail, because there is a chapter in B rocas Brain devoted to him. But each episode of the television series follows fairly closely the corresponding chapter of this book and I like to think that the pleasure of each will be enhanced by reference to the other.",
    "chunk_12": "For clarity, I have in a number of cases introduced an idea more than once the first time lightly, and with deeper passes on subsequent appearances. This occurs, for example, in the introduction to cosmic objects in Chapter 1, which are examined in greater detail later on or in the discussion of mutations, enzymes and nucleic acids in Chapter 2. In a few cases, concepts are presented out of historical order. For example, the ideas of the ancient Greek scientists are presented in Chapter 7, well afte r the discussion of Johannes Kepler in Chapter 3. But I believe an appreciation of the Greeks can best be provided after we see what they barely missed achieving. Because science is inseparable from the rest of the human endeavor, it cannot be discussed without making contact, sometimes glancing, sometimes head on, with a number of social, political, religious and philosophical issues.",
    "chunk_13": "Even in the filming of a telev ision series on science, the worldwide devotion to military activities becomes intrusive. Simulating the exploration of Mars in the Mohave Desert with a full scale version of the Viking Lander, we were repeatedly interrupted by the United States Air Force, performing bombing runs in a nearby test range. In Alexandria, Egypt, from nine to eleven A.M. every morning, our hotel was the subject of practice strafing runs by the Egyptian Air Force. In Samos, Greece, permission to film anywhere was withheld until the very last moment because of NATO maneuvers and what was clearly the construction of a warren of under ground and hillside emplacements for artillery and tanks.",
    "chunk_14": "In Czechoslovakia the use of walkie talkies for organizing the filming logistics on a rural road attracted the attention of a Czech Air Force fighter, which circled overhead until reassured in Czech that no threat to national security was being perpetrated. In Greece, Egypt and Czechoslovakia our film crews were accompanied everywhere by agents of the state security apparatus. Preliminary inquiries about filming in Kaluga, U.S.S.R., for a proposed di scussion of the life of the Russian pioneer of astronautics Konstantin Tsiolkovsky were discouraged because, as we later discovered, trials of dissidents were to be conducted there. Our camera crews met innumerable kindnesses in every country we visited but the global military presence, the fear in the hearts of the nations, was everywhere. The experience confirmed my resolve to treat, when relevant, social questions both in the series and in the book.",
    "chunk_15": "The essence of science is that it is self correcting. New experimental results and novel ideas are continually resolving old mysteries. For example, in Chapter 9 we discuss the fact that the Sun Introduction  xv seems to be generating too few of the elusive particles called neutrinos. Some proposed explanations are listed. In Chapter 10 we wonder whether there is enough matter in the universe eventually to stop the recession of distant galaxies, and whether the un iverse is infinitely old and therefore uncreated.",
    "chunk_16": "Some light on both these questions may since have been cast in experiments by Frederick Reines, of the University of California, who be lieves he has discovered a that neutrinos exist in three different states, only one of which could be detected by neutrino telescopes studying the Sun and b that neutrinos unlike light  have mass, so that the gravity of all the neutrinos in space may help to close the Cosmos and prevent it from expanding forever. Future experiments will show whether these ideas are correct. But they illustrate the continuing and vigorous reassessment of received wisdom which is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. On a project of this magnitude it is impossible to thank everyone who has made a contribution.",
    "chunk_17": "However, I would like to acknowledge, especially, B. Gentry Lee the Cosmos production staff, including the senior producers Geoffrey Haines Stiles and David Ken nard and the executive producer Adrian Malone the artists Jon Lomberg who played a critical role in the original design and organization of the Cosmos visuals, John Allison, Adolf Schaller, Rick Sternbach, Don Davis, Brown, and Anne Norcia consultants Donald Goldsmith, Owen Gingerich, Paul Fox, and Diane Ackerman Cameron Beck the KCET management, particularly Greg Andorfer, who first carried KCETs pro  posal to us, Chuck Allen, William Lamb, and James Loper and the underwriters and co producers of the Cosmos television series, including the Atlantic Richfield Company, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Alfr ed P. Sloan Foundation, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Polytel International.",

I thank the staff at Random House, particularly my editor, Anne Freedgood, and the book designer, Robert Aulicino, for their capable work and their patience when the deadlines for the television series and the book seemed to be in conflict. I ow e a special debt of gratitude to Shirley Arden, my Executive Assistant, for typing the early drafts of this book and ushering the later drafts through all stages of production with her usual cheerful competence. This is only one of many ways in which the C osmos project is deeply indebted to her.",
    "chunk_19": "I am more grateful than I can say to the administration of Cornell University for granting me a two year leave of absence to pursue this project, to my colleagues and students there, and to my colleagues at NASA, JPL and on the Voyager Imaging Team. My greatest debt for the writing of Cosmos is owed to Ann xvi  Introduction Druyan and Steven Soter, my co writers in the television series. They made fundamental and frequent contributions to the basic ideas and their connections, to the overall intellectual structure of the episodes, and to the felicity of style.

I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky. Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations.

Recently, we have waded a little out to sea, enough to dampen our toes or, at most, wet our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls. Some part of our being knows this is from where we came. We long to return. These aspirations are not, I think, irreverent, although they may trouble whatever gods may be. The dimensions of the Cosmos are so large that using familiar units of distance, such as meters or miles, chosen for their utility on Earth, would make little sense.

It measures not time but distances  enormous distances. The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty.

He was also the director of the great library of Alexandria, where one day he read in a papyrus book that in the southern frontier outpost of Syene, near the first cataract of the Nile, at noon on June 21 vertical sticks cast no shadows. On the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, as the hours crept toward midday, the shadows of temple columns grew shorter. At noon, they were gone. A reflection of the Sun could then be seen in the water at the bottom of a deep well. The Sun was d irectly overhead. It was an observation that someone else might easily have ignored.",

But Eratosthenes was a scientist, and his musings on these commonplaces changed the world in a way, they made the world. Eratosthenes had the presence of mind to do an experiment, actually to observe whether in Alexandria vertical sticks cast shadows near noon on June 21. And, he discovered, sticks do. Eratosthenes asked himself how, at the same moment, a stick in Syene could cast no shadow and a stick in Alexandria, far to the north, could cast a pronounced shadow. Consider a map of ancient Egypt with two vertical sticks of equal length, one stuck in Al exandria, the other in Syene. Suppose that, at a certain moment, each stick casts no shadow at all. This is perfectly easy to understand provided the Earth is flat.",
    "chunk_43": "The Sun would then be directly overhead. If the two sticks cast shadows of equal length, th at also would make sense on a flat Earth the Suns rays would then be inclined at the same angle to the two sticks. But how could it be that at the same instant there was no shadow at Syene and a substantial shadow at Alexandria? See p. 16. The only possible answer, he saw, was that the surface of the Earth is curved. Not only that the greater the curvature, the greater the difference in the shadow lengths. The Sun is so far away that its rays are parallel when they reach the Earth. Sticks placed at different angles to the Suns rays cast shadows of di fferent lengths.",

But this notion is a little disconcerting. Each plant and animal is exquisitely made should not a supremely competent Designer have been able to make the int ended variety from the start? The fossil record implies trial and error, an inability to anticipate the future, features inconsistent with an efficient Great Designer although not with a Designer of a more remote and indirect temperament.

We kept them in pint milk bottles. We would cross two varieties to see what new forms emerged from the rearrangement of the parental genes, and from natural and induced mutations. The females would deposit their eggs on a kind of molasses the technicians placed inside the bottles the bottles were stopper ed and we would wait two weeks for the fertilized eggs to become larvae, the larvae pupae, and the pupae to emerge as new adult fruit flies.",

To my astonishment, I came upon something very different not a small variation such as red eyes instead of white, or neck bristles instead of no neck bristles. This was another, and very wellfunctioning, kind of creature with much more prominent wings and long feathery antennae. Fate had arranged, I concluded, that an example of a major evolutionary change in a single generation, the very thing Muller had said could never happen, should take place in his own laboratory. It was my unhappy task to explain it to him. With heavy heart I knocked on his office door. Come in, came the muffled cry.",

I didnt mean to disturb Muller but .. . Does it look more like Lepidoptera than Diptera? he asked, his face illuminated from below. I didnt know what this meant, so he had to explain Does it have big wings? Does it have feathery antennae? I glumly nodded assent. Muller switched on the overhead light and smiled benignly. It was an old story. There was a kind of moth that had adapted to Drosophila genetics laboratories. It was nothing like a fruit fly and wanted nothing to do with fruit flies.",

In the brief time that the laboratory technician took to unstopper and stopper the milk bottle for example, to add fruit flies the mother moth made a dive bombing pass, dropping her eggs on the run into the tasty molasses. I had not discovered a macro mutation. I had merely stumbled upon another lovely adaptation in nature, itself the product of micromu tation and natural selection. The secrets of evolution are death and time the deaths of enormous numbers of lifeforms that were imperfectly adapted to the environment and time for a long succession of small mutations that were by accident adaptive, time for the slow accumulation of patterns of favorable mutations.

A mutation is a change in a nucleotide, copied in the next generation, which breeds true. Since mutations are random nucleotide changes, most of them are harmful or lethal, coding into existence nonfunctional enzymes. It is a long wait before a mutation makes an organism work better. And yet it is that improbable event, a small beneficial mutation in a nucleotide a ten millionth of a centimeter across, that makes evolution go.",

As time went on, they got better at reproducing. Molecules with specialized functions eventually joined together, making a kind of molecular coll ective the first cell. Plant cells today have tiny molecular factories, called chloroplasts, which are in charge of photosynthesis the conversion of sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen.

And you are made of a hundred trillion cells. We are, each of us, a multitude. Sex seems to have been invented around two billion years ago.

But oxygen tends to make organic molecules fall to pieces. De spite our fondness for it, it is fundamentally a poison for unprotected organic matter. The transition to an oxidizing atmosphere posed a supreme crisis in the history of life, and a great many organisms, unable to cope with oxygen, perished.

Then some 600 million years ago, the monopolizing grip of the algae was broken and an enormous proli feration of new lifeforms emerged, an event called the Cambrian explosion.

If you look closely you can often see two t rees pushing and shoving with languid grace. Trees are great and beautiful machines, powered by sunlight, taking in water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air, converting these materials into food for their use and ours.

These are the best that four billion years of evolution could produce, containing the full complement of information on how to make a cell, a tree or a human work.

    "chunk_107": "What is more, the DNA molecules know how to make, with only very rare exceptions, identical copies of themselves. They know extraordinarily much. DNA is a double helix, the two intertwined strands resembling a spiral staircase. It is the sequence or ordering of the nucleotides along either of the constituent strands that is the language of life. During reproduction, the helices separate, assisted by a special unwinding protein, each synthesizing an identical copy of the other from nucleotide building blocks floating about nearby in the viscous liquid of the cell nucleus. Once the unwinding is underway, a remarkable enzyme called DNA polymerase help s ensure that the copying works almost perfectly. If a mistake is made, there are enzymes which snip the mistake out and replace the wrong nucleotide by the right one. These enzymes are a molecular machine with awesome powers.",

Accordingly, the number of possible individual human beings is vastly greater than the number that have ever lived the untapped potential of the human species is immense. There must be ways of putting nucleic acids together that will function far better by any criterion we choose than any human being who has ever lived. Fortunately, we do not yet know how to assemble alternative sequences of nucleotides to make alternative kinds of human beings. In the future we may well be able to assemble nucleotides in any desired sequence, to produce whatever char acteristics we think desirable a sobering and disquieting prospect. Evolution works through mutation and selection. Mutations might occur during replication if the enzyme DNA polymerase makes a mistake.",

Mutations also occur because of radioactivity or ultraviolet light from the Sun or cosmic rays or chemicals in the environment, all of which can change the nucleotides or tie the nucleic acids up in knots. If the mutation rate is too high, we lose the inheritance of four billion years of painstaking evolution. If it is too low, new varieties wi ll not be available to adapt to some future change in the environment. The evolution of life requires a more or less precise balance between mutation and selection. When that balance is achieved, remarkable adaptations occur. A change in a single DNA nucleotide causes a change in a single amino acid in the protein for which that DNA codes.

They are no more than a single strand of RNA with either a linear or a closed circular geometry. Viroids can be so small and still thrive because they are thoroughgoing, unremitting para sites.

Salpeter and I imagined floaters kilometers across, enormously larger than the greatest whale that ever was, beings the size of cities. The floaters may propel themselves through the planetary atmosphere with gusts of gas, like a ramjet or a rocket.

That man was Tycho Brahe. By chance, at Rudolfs suggestion, he had just invited Kepler, whose mathematical fame was growing, to join him in Prague. A provincial schoolteacher of humble origins, unknown to all but a few mathematicians, Kepler was diffident about Tychos offer. But the decision was made for him.

He envisioned Tychos domain as a refuge from the evils of the time, as the place where his Cosmic Mystery would be confirmed. He aspired to become a colleague of the great Tycho Brahe, who for thirty  five years had devoted himself, before the invention of the telescope, to the measurement of a clockwork universe, ordered and precise.

The birth of modern science the offspring of theory and observa tionteetered on the precipice of their mutual mistrust. In the remaining eighteen months that Tycho was to live, the two quarreled and were reconciled repeatedly. At a dinner given by the Baron of Rosenberg, Tycho, having robustly drunk much wine, placed civility ahead of health, and resisted his bodys urgings to leave, even if briefly, before the baron. The consequent urinary infection worsened when Tycho resolutely rejected advice to temper his eating and drinking.

His conjecture that the orbits of the planets are circumscribed by the five platonic solids was no more supported by Tych os data than by Copernicus. His Cosmic Mystery was disproved entirely by the much later discoveries of the planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto  there are no additional platonic solids that would determine their distances from the sun. The nested Pythagor ean solids also made no allowance for the existence of the Earths moon, and Galileos discovery of the four large moons of Jupiter was also discomfiting. But far from becoming morose, Kepler wished to find additional satellites and wondered how many satel lites each planet should have.",
    "chunk_184": "He wrote to Galileo I immediately began to think how there could be any addition to the number of the planets without overturning my Mysterium Cosmographicum, according to which Euclids five regular solids do not allow more than six planets around the Sun ... I am so far from disbelieving the existence of the four circ umjovial planets that I long for a telescope, to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering two around Mars, as the proportion seems to require, six or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each round Mercury and Venus. Mars does have two small moons, and a major geological feature on the larger of them is today  The proof of this statement can be found in Appendix 2. The Harmony of Worlds  61 120  Cosmos called the Kepler Ridge in honor of this guess.",
    "chunk_185": "But he was entirely mistaken about Saturn, Mercury and Venus, and Jupiter has many more moons than Galileo discovered. We still do not really know why there are only nine planets, more or less, and why they h ave the relative distances from the Sun that they do. See Chapter 8. Tychos observations of the apparent motion of Mars and other planets through the constellations were made over a period of many years. These data, from the last few decades before the telescope was invented, were the most accurate that had yet been obtained. Kepler worked with a passionate intensity to understand them What real motion of the Earth and Mars about the Sun could explain, to the precision of measurement, the apparent motion of Mars in the sky, including its retrograde loops through the background constellations?",
    "chunk_186": "Tycho had commended Mars to Kepler because its apparent motion seemed most anomalous, most difficult to reconcile with an orbit made of circles. To the reader who might be bored by his many calculations, he later wrote If you are wearied by this tedious procedure, take pity on me who carried out at least seventy trials. Pythagoras, in the sixth century B.C., Plato, Ptolemy and all the Christian astronomers before Kepler had assumed that the planets moved in circular paths. The circle was thought to be a perfect geometrical shape and the planets, placed high in the heavens, away from earthly corruption, were also thought to be in some mystical sense perfect.",
    "chunk_187": "Galileo, Tycho and Copernicus were all committed to uniform circular planetary motion, the latter asserting that the mind shudders at the alternative, because  it would be unworthy to suppose such a thing in a Creation constituted in the best possible way. So at first Kepler tried to explain the observations by imagining that the Earth and Mars moved in circular orbits about the Sun. After three years of calculation, he believed he had found the correct values for a Martian circular orbit, which matched ten of Tychos observations within two minutes of arc. Now, there are 60 minutes of arc in an angular degree, and 90 degrees, a right angle, from the horizon to the zenith. So a few minutes of arc is a very small quantity to measure especially without a telescope. It is one fifteenth the angular diameter of the full Moon as seen from Earth.",
    "chunk_188": "But Keplers replenishable ecstasy soon crumble d into gloom because two of Tychos further observations were inconsistent with Keplers orbit, by as much as eight minutes of arc Divine Providence granted us such a diligent observer in Tycho Brahe that his observations convicted this . . . calculation of an error of eight minutes it is only right that we should accept Gods gift with a grateful mind . . .

The difference between a circular orbit and the true orbit could be distinguished only by precise measurement and a courageous acceptance of the facts The universe is stamped with the adornment of harmonic proportions, but harmonies must accommodate expe rience. Kepler was shaken at being compelled to abandon a circular orbit and to question his faith in the Divine Geometer. Having cleared the stable of astronomy of circles and spirals, he was left, he said, with only a single cartful of dung, a stretch edout circle something like an oval.",
    "chunk_190": "Eventually, Kepler came to feel that his fascination with the circle had been a delusion. The Earth was a planet, as Copernicus had said, and it was entirely obvious to Kepler that the Earth, wracked by wars, pestilence, famine and unhappiness, fell short of perfection. Kepler was one of the first people since antiquity to propose that the planets were material objects made of imperfect stuff like the Earth. And if planets were imperfect, why not their orbits as well? He tried various ovallike curves, ca lculated away, made some arithmetical mistakes which caused him at first to reject the correct answer and months later in some desperation tried the formula for an ellipse, first codified in the Alexandrian Library by Apollonius of Perga.",
    "chunk_191": "He found that i t matched Tychos observations beautifully The truth of nature, which I had rejected and chased away, returned by stealth through the back door, disguising itself to be accepted . . . Ah, what a foolish bird I have been! Kepler had found that Mars moves about the Sun not in a circle, but in an ellipse. The other planets have orbits much less elliptical than that of Mars, and if Tycho had urged him to study the motion of, say, Venus, Kepler might never have discovered the t rue orbits of the planets. In such an orbit the Sun is not at the center but is offset, at the focus of the ellipse. When a given planet is at its nearest to the Sun, it speeds up. When it is at its farthest, it slows down.",
    "chunk_192": "Such motion is why we describe t he planets as forever falling toward, but never reaching, the Sun. Keplers first law of planetary motion is simply this A planet moves in an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. In uniform circular motion, an equal angle or fraction of the arc of a circle is covered in equal times. So, for example, it takes twice as long to go two thirds of the way around a circle as it does to go one third of the way around. Kepler found somethin g different for elliptical orbits As the planet moves along its orbit, it sweeps out a little wedge shaped area within the ellipse.",
    "chunk_193": "When it is close to the Sun, in a given period of time it traces out a large arc in its orbit, but the area represented by that arc is not very large because the planet is then near the Sun. When the planet is far from the Sun, it covers a much smaller arc in the same period The Harmony of Worlds  122 of time, but that arc corresponds to a bigger area because the Sun is now more distant. Kepler found that these two areas were precisely the same no matter how elliptical the orbit the long skinny area, corresponding to the planet far from the Sun, and th e shorter, squatter area, when the planet is close to the Sun, are exactly equal. This was Keplers second law of planetary motion Planets sweep out equal areas in equal times.",
    "chunk_194": "Keplers first two laws may seem a little remote and abstract planets move in ellipses, and sweep out equal areas in equal dmes. Well, so what? Circular motion is easier to grasp. We might have a tendency to dismiss these laws as mere mathemati  cal tinkering, something removed from everyday life. But these are the laws our planet obeys as we ourselves, glued by gravity to the surface of the Earth, hurtle through interplanetary space. We move in accord with laws of nature that Kepler first discove red. When we send spacecraft to the planets, when we observe double stars, when we examine the motion of distant galaxies, we find that throughout the universe Keplers laws are obeyed.",
    "chunk_195": "Many years later, Kepler came upon his third and last law of planetary motion, a law that relates the motion of various planets to one another, that lays out correctly the clockwork of the solar system. He described it in a book called The Harmonies of the World. Kepler understood many things by the word harmony the order and beauty of planetary motion, the existence of mathematical laws explaining that motion an idea that goes back to Pythagoras and even harmony in the musical sense, the harmony of the spheres. Unlike the orbits of Mercury and Mars, the orbits of the other planets depart so little from circularity that we cannot make out their true shapes even in an extremely accurate diagram. The Earth is our moving platform from which we observe the motion of the other planets against the backdrop of distant constellations.",
    "chunk_196": "The inner planets move rapidly in their orbits that is why Mercury has the name it does Mercury was the messenger of the gods. Venus, Earth and Mars move progressively less rapidly about the Sun. The outer planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, move stately and slow, as befits th e kings of the gods. Keplers third or harmonic law states that the squares of the periods of the planets the times for them to complete one orbit are proportional to the cubes of their average distance from the Sun the more distant the planet, the more slowly it moves, but according to a precise mathematical law P2  a3 where P represents the period of revolution of the planet about the Sun, measured in years, and a the distance of the planet from the Sun measured in astronomical units.",

What number times itself equals 125? Why, 11, close enough. And 11 years is the period for Jupiter to go once around the Sun. Keplers third or harmonic law, a precise connection between the size of a planets orbit and the period for it to go once around the Sun. It clearly applies to Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, planets discovered long after Keplers death. 123  Cosmos A similar argument applies for every planet and asteroid and comet. Not content merely to have extracted from Nature the laws of planetary motion, Kepler endeavored to find some still more fundamental underlying cause, some influence of the Sun on the kinematics of worlds.",
    "chunk_198": "The planets sped up on approaching the Sun and slo wed down on retreating from it. Somehow the distant planets sensed the Suns presence. Magnetism also was an influence felt at a distance, and in a stunning anticipation of the idea of universal gravitation, Kepler suggested that the underlying cause was a kin to magnetism My aim in this is to show that the celestial machine is to be likened not to a divine organism but rather to a clockwork . . . , insofar as nearly all the manifold movements are carried out by means of a single, quite simple magnetic force, as in the case of a clockwork where all motions are caused by a simple weight.",
    "chunk_199": "Magnetism is, of course, not the same as gravity, but Keplers fundamental innovation here is nothing short of breathtaking he proposed that quantitative physical laws that apply to the Earth are also the underpinnings of quantitative physical laws that govern the heavens. It was the first nonmystical explanation of motion in the heavens it made the Earth a province of the Cosmos. Astronomy, he said is part of physics. Kepler stood at a cusp in history the last scientific astrologer was the first as trophysicist. Not given to quiet understatement, Kepler assessed his discoveries in these words With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist. . . .

He claimed that in the harmony of the spheres, the tones of Earth are fa and mi, that the Earth is forever humming fa and mi, and that they stand in a straightforward way for the Latin word for famine.

Because of the length of the lunar day and night Kepler described the great intemperateness of climate and the most violent alternation of extreme heat and cold on the Moon, which is entirely correct. Of course, he did not get everything right. He believ ed, for example, that there was a substantial lunar atmosphere and oceans and inhabitants.",
    "chunk_207": "Most curious is his view of the origin of the lunar craters, which make the Moon, he says, not dissimilar to the face of a boy disfigured with smallpox. He argued correctly that the craters are depressions rather than mounds. From his own observations he noted the ramparts surrounding many craters and the existence of central peaks. But he thought that their regular circular shape implied such a degree of order that only intelligent life could explain them. He did not realize that 128  Cosmos great rocks falling out of the sky would produce a local explosion, perfectly symmetric in all directions, that would carve out a circular cavity the origin of the bulk of the craters on the Moon and the other terrestrial planets. He deduced instead the e xistence of some race rationally capable of constructing those hollows on the surface of the Moon.",

Against the view that such gre at construction projects were unlikely, Kepler offered as counterexamples the pyramids of Egypt and the Great Wall of China, which can, in fact, be seen today from Earth orbit. The idea that geometrical order reveals an underlying intelligence was central to Keplers life. His argument on the lunar tradition of some scientists who believe that only they and the temporal and ecclesiastical powers can be trusted with arcane knowledge It serves no useful purpose and is unreasonable, to make such things gen  erally known. Kepler, on the other hand, lectured on astronomy in schools, published extensively and often at his own expense, and wrote science fiction, which was certainly not intended primarily for his scientific peers.",
    "chunk_209": "He may not have been a popular w riter of science in the modern sense, but the transition in attitudes in the single generation that separated Tycho and Kepler is telling. The Harmony of Worlds  129 craters is a clear foreshadowing of the Martian canal controversy Chapter 5. It is striking that the observational search for extraterrestrial life began in the same generation as the invention of the telescope, and with the greatest theoretician of the age. Parts of the Somnium were clearly autobiographical. The hero, for example, visits Tycho Brahe. He has parents who sell drugs. His mother consorts with spirits and daemons, one of whom eventually provides the means to travel to the moon.",

Science fiction was a new idea at the time of the Thir ty Years War, and Keplers book was used as evidence that his mother was a witch. In the midst of other grave personal problems, Kepler rushed to W\u00fcrttemberg to find his seventy fouryearold mother chained in a Protestant secular dungeon and threatened, like Galileo in a Catholic dungeon, with torture. He set about, as a scientist natu rally would, to find natural explanations for the various events that had precipitated the accusations of witchcraft, including minor physical ailments that the burghers of W\u00fcrttemberg had attributed to her spells.",

The upheavals of the war deprived Kepler of much of his financial support, and the end of his life was spent fitfully, pleading for money and sponsors. He cast horoscopes for the Duke of Wallenstein, as he had done for Rudolf II, and spent his final years in a Silesian town controlled by Wallenstein and called Sagan.

He was persuaded that the revealed documents gave no support to the Trinitarian doctrines which were due to late falsifications. The revealed God was one God.

This force Newton called gravity, and believed that it acted at a distance. There is nothing physically connecting the Earth and the Moon. And yet the Earth is constantly pulling the Moon toward us. Using Keplers third law, Newton mathematically deduced the nature of the gravitational force.

Like the Moon, they all bear witness to an age of impact catastrophism in the early history of the solar system. As we move out past Mars we enter a very different regime  the realm of Jupiter and the other giant or jovian planets. These are great worlds, composed largely of hydrogen and helium, with smaller amounts of hydrogen rich gases such as methane, ammonia and water. We do not see solid surfaces here, only the atmosphere and the multicolored clouds. These are serious planets, not fragmentary worldlets like the Earth. A thousand Earths could fit inside Jupiter.",
    "chunk_263": "If a comet or an asteroid dropped into the atmosphe re of Jupiter, we would not expect a visible crater, only a momentary break in the clouds. Nevertheless, we know there has been a many billion year history of collisions in the outer solar system as well because Jupiter has a great system of more than a dozen moons, five of which were examined close up by the Voyager spacecraft. Here again we find evidence of past catastrophes. When the solar system is all explo red, we will probably have evidence for impact catastrophism on all nine worlds, from Mercury to Pluto, and on all the smaller moons, comets and asteroids.

And since Meteor Crater, Arizona, an impact crater about a kilometer across, has been found to be twenty or thirty thousand years old, the observations on the Earth are in agreement with such crude calculations. The actual impact of a small comet or asteroid with the Moon might make a momentary explosion sufficiently bright to be visible from the Earth. We can imagine our ancestors gazing idly up on some night a hundred thousand years ago and noting a strange clou d arising from the unilluminated part of the Moon, suddenly struck by the Suns rays. But we would not expect such an event to have happened in historical times.",

Nevertheless, there is an histori cal account which may in fact describe an impact on the Moon seen from Earth with the naked eye On the evening of June 25, 1178, five British monks reported something extraordinary, which was later recorded in the chronicle of Gervase of Canterbury, gener ally considered a reliable reporter on the political and cultural events of his time, after he had interviewed the eyewitnesses who asserted, under oath, the truth of their story. The chronicle reads There was a bright New Moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tilted towards the east. Suddenly, the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of the division, a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out fire, hot coals, and sparks.",
    "chunk_268": "The astronomers Derral Mulholland and Odile Calame have calculated that a lunar impact would produce a dust cloud rising off the surface of the Moon with an appearance corresponding rather closely to the report of the Canterbury monks. If such an impact were made only 800 years ago, the crater should still be visible. Erosion on the Moon is so inefficient, because of the absence of air and water, that even small craters a few billion years old are still comparatively well preserved. From the description recorded by Gervase, it is possible to pinpoint the sector of the Moon to which the observations refer. Impacts produce rays, linear trails of fine powder spewed out during the explosion. Such rays are associated with the very youngest cra ters on the Moon for example, those named after Aristarchus and Copernicus and Kepler.",

For this and other crimes he was burned at the stake in the year 1600. Another line of evidence consistent with this interpretation has been provided by Calame and Mulholland. When an object impacts the Moon at high speed, it sets the Moon slightly wob bling. Eventually the vibrations die down but not in so short a period as eight hundred years. Such a quivering can be studied by laser reflection techniques. The Apollo astronauts emplaced in several locales on the Moon special mirrors called laser retror eflectors. When a laser beam from Earth strikes the mirror and bounces back, the round trip travel time can be measured with remarkable precision.",
    "chunk_271": "This time multiplied by the speed of light gives us the distance to the Moon at that moment to equally remark able precision. Such measurements, performed over a period of years, reveal the Moon to be librating, or quivering with a period about three years and amplitude about three meters, consistent with the idea that the crater Giordano Bruno was gouged out less than a thousand years ago. All this evidence is inferential and indirect. The odds, as I have said, are against such an event happening in historical times. But the evidence is at least suggestive. As the Tunguska Event and Meteor Crater, Arizona, also remind us, not all impact cata strophes occurred in the early history of the solar system. But the fact that only a few of the lunar craters have extensive ray systems also reminds us that, even 164  Cosmos on the Moon, some erosion occurs.",

On page 89 is an attempt to visualize the events that made the surface of the lunar hemisphere we see from Earth. The Earth is very near the Moon. If the Moon is so severely cratered by impacts, how has the Earth avoided them? Why is Meteor Crater so rare? Do the comets and asteroids think it inadvisable to impact an inhabited planet? This is an unlikely forbearance.",
    "chunk_273": "The only possible explanation is that impact craters are formed at very similar rates on both the Earth and the Moon, but that on the airless, waterless Moon they are preserved for immense periods of time, while on the Earth slow erosion wipes them out or fills them in. Running water, windblown sand and mountain building are very slow processes. But over millions or billions of years, they are capable of utterly erasing even very large impact scars. On the surface of any moon or planet, there will be external processes, such as impacts from space, and internal processes, such as earthquakes there will be fast, catastrophic events, such as volcanic explosions, and processes of excruciating slowness, s uch as the pitting of a surface by tiny airborne sand grains.",
    "chunk_274": "There is no general answer to the question of which processes dominate, the outside ones or the inside ones the rare but violent events, or the common and inconspicuous occurrences. On the Moon , the outside, catastrophic events hold sway on Earth, the inside, slow processes dominate. Mars is an intermediate case. Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter are countless asteroids, tiny terrestrial planets. The largest are a few hundred kilometers across. Many have oblong shapes and are tumbling through space. In some cases there seem to be two or more asteroids in tight mutual orbits. Collisions among the asteroids happen frequently, and occasionally a piece is chipped off and accidentally intercepts the Earth, falling to the ground as a meteorite.

Rings may be a typical adornment of Jovian type planets throughout the cosmo s.

It also caused, he said, extensive vulcan  ism and floods. Velikovsky imagined the comet, after a complicated game of interplanetary billiards, to settle down into a stable, nearly cir cular orbit, becoming the planet Venus which he claimed never existed before then. As I have discussed at some length elsewhere, these ideas are almost certainly wrong. Astronomers do not object to the idea of major collisions, only to major recent collisions.",

If the planets were really shown to scale, as grains of dust, we would easily note that the chance of collision of a particular comet with the Earth in a few thousand years is extraordinarily low.

It is very unlikely that an object in such a highly elliptical orbit could he rapidly moved into the nearly perfectly circular orbit of present day Venus. And so on.

    "chunk_288": "But only careful accumulation and assessment of the evidence can tell us whether a given world is inhabited. Venus turns out not to oblige our predispositions. The first real clue to the nature of Venus came from work with a prism made of glass or a flat surface, called a diffraction grating, covered with fine, regularly spaced, ruled lines. When an intense beam of ordinary white light passes through a narrow sli t and then through a prism or grating, it is spread into a rainbow of colors called a spectrum. The spectrum runs from high frequencies of visible light to low ones violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. Since we see these colors, it is called the s pectrum of visible light.

But because of the limitations of our eyes, we have a prejudice, a bias, toward that tiny rainbow band we call the spectrum of visible light.

    "chunk_291": "We would never physically visit them, he thought, and with no sample in hand it seemed we would forever be denied knowledge of their composition. But only three years after Comtes death, it was discovered that a spectrum can be used to determine the chemistry of distant objects. Different molecules and chemical elements absorb differe nt frequencies or colors of light, sometimes in the visible and sometimes elsewhere in the spectrum. In the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere, a single dark line represents an image of the slit in which light is missing, the absorption of sunlight during its brief passage through the air of another world.

    "chunk_294": "But the first spectroscopic searches, attempted at Mount Wilson Observatory around 1920, found not a hint, not a trace, of water vapor above the clouds of Venus, suggesting an arid, desert like surface, surmounted by clouds of fine drifting silicate dust. Further study revealed enormous quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, implying to some scientists that all the water on the planet had combined with hyd rocarbons to form carbon dioxide, and that therefore the surface of Venus was a global oil field, a planet wide sea of petroleum. Others concluded that there was no water vapor above the clouds because the clouds were very cold, that all the water had cond ensed out into water droplets, which do not have the same pattern of spectral lines as water vapor.",
    "chunk_295": "They suggested that the planet was totally covered with water except perhaps for an occasional limestone encrusted island, like the cliffs of Dover. But because of the vast quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the sea could not be ordinary water physical chemistry required carbonated water. Venus, they proposed, had a vast ocean of seltzer. The first hint of the true situation came not from spectroscopic studies in the visible or near infrared parts of the spectrum, but rather from the radio region. A radio telescope works more like a light meter than a camera. You point it toward some fairly broad region of the sky, and it records how much energy, in a particular radio frequency, is coming down to Earth. We are used to radio signals transmitted by some varieties of intelligent life namely, those who run radio and television stations.",
    "chunk_296": "But ther e are many other reasons for natural objects to give off radio waves. One is that they are hot. And when, in 1956, an early radio telescope was turned toward Venus, it was discovered to be emitting radio waves as if it were at an extremely high temperature . But the real demonstration that the surface of Venus is astonishingly hot came when the Soviet spacecraft of the Venera series first penetrated the obscuring clouds and landed on the mysterious and inaccessible surface of the nearest planet. Venus, it tu rns out, is broiling hot. There are no swamps, no oil fields, no seltzer oceans. With insufficient data, it is easy to go wrong. When I greet a friend, I am seeing her in reflected visible light, generated by the Sun, say, or by an incandescent lamp. The light rays bounce off my friend and into my eye.",
    "chunk_297": "But the ancients, including no less a figure than Euclid, believed that we see by virtue of rays somehow emitted by the eye and tangibly, actively contacting the object observed. This is a natural notion and can still be encountered, although it does not account for the invisibility of objects in a darkened room. Today we combine a laser and a photocell, or a radar transmitter and a radio telescope, and in this way make active contact by light with distant objects. In radar astronomy, radio waves are transmitted by a telescope on Heaven and Hell  95 Earth, strike, say, that hemisphere of Venus that happens to he facing the Earth, and bounce hack. At many wavelengths the clouds and atmosphere of Venus are entirely transparent to radio waves.",
    "chunk_298": "Some places on the surface will absorb them or, it they are very rough, will scatter them sideways and so will appear dark to radio waves. By following the surface features moving with Venus as it rotates, it was possible for the first time to determine reliably the length of its day  how long it takes Venus to spin once on its axis. It turns out that, with respect to the stars, Venus turns once every 245 Earth days, but backwards, in the opposite direction from all other planets in the inner solar system. As a result, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, taking 118 Earth days from sunrise to sunrise. What is more, it presents almost exactly the same face to the Earth each time it is closest to our planet.",
    "chunk_299": "However the Earths gravity has managed to nudge Venus into this Earth locked rotation rate, it cannot have happened rapidly. Venus could not be a mere few thousand ye ars old but, rather, it must be as old as all the other objects in the inner solar system. Radar pictures of Venus have been obtained, some from ground  based radar telescopes, some from the Pioneer Venus vehicle in orbit around the planet. They show provocative evidence of impact craters. There are just as many craters that are not too big or to o small on Venus as there are in the lunar highlands, so many that Venus is again telling us that it is very old.",
    "chunk_300": "But the craters of Venus are remarkably shallow, almost as it the high surface temperatures have produced a kind of rock that flows over long periods of time, like taffy or putty, gradually softening the relief.

Eve n at its high, cool clouds, Venus turns out to be a thoroughly nasty place. High above the visible cloud deck, at about 70 kilometers altitude, there is a continuous haze of small particles. At 60 kilometers, we plunge into the clouds, and find ourselves surrounded by droplets of concentrated sulfuric acid. As we go deeper, the cl oud particles tend to get bigger.

Venus is a kind of planet wide catastrophe. It now seems reasonably clear that the high surface temperature comes about through a massive greenhouse effect.

There is an additional factor that can alter the landscape and the climate of Earth intelligent life, able to make major environmental changes. Like Venus, the Earth also has a greenhouse effect due to its carbon dioxide and water vapor. The global temperature of the Earth would be below the freezing point of water if not for the greenhouse effect. It keeps the oceans liquid and life possible. A little greenhouse is a good thing.",

If the Earth were moved only a little closer to the Sun, the temperature would increase slightly. This would dr ive some of the CO 2 out of the surface rocks, generating a stronger greenhouse effect, which would in turn incrementally heat the surface further. A hotter surface would vaporize still more carbonates into CO 2, and there would be the possibility of a runaw ay greenhouse effect to very high temperatures.

Slash andburn agriculture, industrial tropical deforestation and overgrazing are rampant today. But forests are darker than grasslands, and grass lands are darker than deserts. As a consequence, the amount of sunlight that is absorbed by the ground has been declining, and by changes in the land use we are lowering the surface tempera ture of our planet. Might this cooling increase the size of the polar ice cap, which, because it is bright, will reflect still more sunlight from the Earth, further cooling the planet, driving a runaway albedo effect? Our lovely blue planet, the Earth, is the only home we know. Venus is too hot. Mars is too cold. But the Earth is just right, a heaven for humans. After all, we evolved here.",
    "chunk_323": "But our congenial climate may be unstable. We are perturbing our poor planet in serious and contradictory ways. Is there any danger of driving the environment of the Earth toward the planetary Hell of Venus or the global ice age of Mars? The simple answer is that nobody knows. The study of the global climate, the comparison of the Earth with other worlds, are subjects in their earliest stages of development. They are fields that are poorly and grudgingly funded. In our ignorance, we continue to push and pull, to pollute the atmosphere and brighten the land, oblivious of the fact that the long term consequences are largely unknown. A few million years ago, when human beings first evolved on Earth, it was already a middle aged world, 4.6 billion years along from the catastrophes and impetuosities of its youth.",

Or will we think on longer time scales, with concern for our children and our grandchildren, to understand and protect the complex life support systems of our planet? The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished. The albedo is the fraction of the sunlight striking a planet that is reflected back to space.

Three years before The War of the Worlds was pub lished, a Bostonian named Percival Lowell founded a major observatory where the most elaborate claims in support of life on Mars were developed.

Lowells Mars had many features in common with the American Southwest, where the Lowell Observatory was located. He imagined the Martian tempera tures a little on the chilly side but still as comfortable as the South of England. The air was thin, but there was enough oxygen to be breathable. Water was rare, but the elegant network of canals carried the life giving fluid all over the planet. What was in retrospect the most serious contemporary challenge to Lowells ideas came from an unlikely source.

And as for the water in the canals Any attempt to make that scanty surplus of water, by means of overflowing canals, travel across the equator into the opposite hemisphere, through such terrible desert regions and exposed to such a cloudless sky as Mr. Lowell describes, would be the work of a body of madmen rather than of intelligent beings. It may be safely asserted that not one drop of water would escape evaporation or insoak at even a hundred miles from its source. This devastating and largely correct physical analysis was written in Wallaces eighty fourth year.

It had a mythic quality as old as Genesi s. Part of its appeal was the fact that the nineteenth century was an age of engineering marvels, including the construction of enormous canals the Suez Canal, completed in 1869 the Corinth Canal, in 1893 the Panama Canal, in 1914 and, closer to home, the Great Lake locks, the barge canals of upper New York State, and the irrigation canals of the American Southwest.

However, with pictures far more detailed than any view of Mars that Lowell could have g limpsed, we have found not a tributary of the vaunted canal network, not one lock. Lowell and Schiaparelli and others, doing visual observations under difficult seeing con ditions, were misled in part perhaps because of a predisposition to believe in life on Mars.

It was not that Lowells eye had strung up disconnected fine detail on the Martian surface into illusory straight lines.

How could other astronomers some of whom said they had not examined Lowells maps closely until after their own observations  have drawn the same canals?

They are due to windblown dust, the patterns varying with the seas onal winds. But the streaks do not have the character of the canals, they are not in the position of the canals, and none of them is large enough individually to be seen from the Earth in the first place.",

But this is hardly a comprehensive explanation, and I have the nagging suspicion that some essential feature of the Martian canal problem still remains undiscovered.

But when we improve the resolution tenfold, when we begin to see detail as small as a hundred meters across, the situation changes. Many places on Earth seem suddenly to crystallize out, revealing an intricate pattern of squares and rectangles, straight li nes and circles.

However, there are many other possibilities, ranging from large plants and animals to microorganisms, to extinct forms, to a planet that is now and was always lifeless.

Its air is thin, containing mostly carbon dioxide but also some molecular nitrogen and argon and very small quantities of water vapor, oxygen and ozone.",

Every year or two the relative positions of the planets and the physics of Kepler and Newton permit the launch of a spacecraft to Mars or Venus with a minimum expenditure of en ergy. Since the early 1960s the U.S.S.R. has missed few such opportunities. Soviet persistence and engineering skills have eventually paid off handsomely.

A spacecraft descending on the shrouds of a large parachute is particularly vulnerable to horizontal winds. After landing, Mars 3 may have made a few bounces, hit a boulder or other example of Martian relief, tipped over, lost the radio link with its carrier bus and failed. But why did Mars 3 enter in the midst of a great dust storm? The Mars 3 mission was rigidly organized before launch.",

There was no planet wide storm when this spacecraft entered the Martian atmosphere, and no reason to suspect a local s torm, as sometimes happens, at the landing site. Perhaps there was an engineering failure just at the moment of touchdown. Or perhaps there is something particularly dangerous about the Martian surface.",
    "chunk_366": "The combination of Soviet successes in landing on Venus and Soviet failures in landing on Mars naturally caused us some concern about the U.S. Viking mission, which had been informally scheduled to set one of its two descent craft gently down on the Martia n surface on the Bicentennial of the United States, July 4, 1976. Like its Soviet predecessors, the Viking landing maneuver involved an ablation shield, a parachute and retro rockets. Because the Martian atmosphere is only 1 percent as dense as the Earths , a very large parachute, eighteen meters in diameter, was deployed to slow the spacecraft as it entered the thin air of Mars. The atmosphere is so thin that if Viking had landed at a high elevation there would not have been enough atmosphere to brake the descent adequately it would have crashed.",

To avoid the probable fate of Mars 3, we wanted Viking to land in a place and time at which the winds were low. Winds that would make the lander crash were probably strong enough to lift dust off the surface. If we could check that the candidate landing si te was not covered with shifting, drifting dust, we would have at least a fair chance of guaranteeing that the winds were not intolerably high. This was one reason that each Viking lander was carried into Mars orbit with its Orbiter, and descent delayed un til the Orbiter surveyed the landing site.",
    "chunk_369": "We had discovered with Mariner 9 that characteristic changes in the bright and dark patterns on the Martian surface occur during times of high winds. We certainly would not have certified a Viking landing site as safe if orbital photographs had shown such shifting patterns. But our guarantees could not be 100 percent reliable. For example, we could imagine a landing site at which the winds were so strong that all mobile dust had already been blown away. We would th en have had no indication of the high winds that might have been there. Detailed weather predictions for Mars were, of course, much less reliable than for Earth. Indeed one of the many objectives of the Viking mission was to improve our understanding of the weather on both planets. Because of communication and temperature constraints, Viking could not land at high Martian latitudes.",
    "chunk_370": "Farther poleward than about 45 or 50 degrees in both hemispheres, either the time of useful communication of the spacecraft with the Earth or the period during which the spacecraft would avoid dangerously low temperatures would have been awkwardly short. We did not wish to land in too rough a place. The spacecraft A Soviet postage stamp illustrating the descent of the Mars 3 spacecraft, still in its ablation shield, through a raging dust storm on December 2, 1971. might have tipped over and crashed, or at the least its mechanical arm, intended to acquire Martian soil samples, might have be come wedged or been left waving helplessly a meter too high above the surface. Likewise, we did not want to land in places that were too soft.",
    "chunk_371": "If the spacecrafts three landing pods had sunk deeply into a loosely packed soil, various undesirable consequenc es would have followed, including immobilization of the sample arm. But we did not want to land in a place that was too hard either had we landed in a vitreous lava field, for example, with no powdery surface material, the mechanical arm would have been un able to acquire the samples vital to the projected chemistry and biology experiments. The best photographs then available of Mars from the Mariner 9 Orbiter showed features no smaller than 90 meters 100 yards across. The Viking Orbiter pictures improved this figure only slightly. Boulders one meter three feet in size were entirely invis ible in such photographs, and could have had disastrous consequences for the Viking lander. Likewise, a deep, soft powder might have been undetectable photographically.",
    "chunk_372": "Fortunately, there was a technique that enabled us to determine the roughness or softness of a candidate landing site radar. A very Blues for a Red Planet  119 rough place would scatter radar from Earth off to the sides of the beam and therefore appear poorly reflective, or radar dark. A very soft place would also appear poorly reflective because of the many interstices between individual sand grains. While we were unable to distinguish between rough places and soft places, we d id not need to make such distinctions for landing site selection. Both, we knew, were dangerous. Preliminary radar surveys suggested that as much as a quarter to a third of the surface area of Mars might be radar dark, and therefore dangerous for Viking. B ut not all of Mars can be viewed by Earth based radar only a swath between about 25N and about 25S.",
    "chunk_373": "The Viking Orbiter carried no radar system of its own to map the surface. There were many constraints perhaps, we feared, too many. Our landing sites had to be not too high, too windy, too hard, too soft, too rough or too close to the pole. It was remarkable that there were any places at all on Mars that simultaneously satisfied all our safety criteria. But it was also clear that our search for safe harbors had led us to landing sites that were, by and large, dull. When each of the two Viking orbiter lander combinations was inserted into Martian orbit, it was unalterably committed to landing at a certain latitude on Mars.",
    "chunk_374": "If the low point in the orbit was at 21 Martian north latitude, the lander would touch down at 21N, although, by waiting for the planet to turn beneath it, it could land at any longitude whatever. Thus the Viking science teams selected candidate latitudes for which there was more than one promising site. Viking 1 was targeted for 21N. The prime si te was in a region called Chryse Greek for the land of gold, near the confluence of four sinuous channels thought to have been carved in previous epochs of Martian history by running water. The Chryse site seemed to satisfy all safety criteria. But the radar observations had been made nearby, not in the Chryse landing site itself. Radar observations of Chryse were made for the first time because of the geometry of Earth and Mars  only a few weeks before the nominal landing date.",
    "chunk_375": "The candidate landing latitude for Viking 2 was 44N the prime site, a locale called Cydonia, chosen because, according to some theoretical arguments, there was a significant chance of small quantities of liquid water there, at least at some time during t he Martian year. Since the Viking biology experiments were strongly oriented toward organisms that are comfortable in liquid water, some scientists held that the chance of Viking finding life would be substantially improved in Cydonia. On the other hand, i t was argued that, on so windy a planet as Mars, microorganisms should be everywhere if they are anywhere. There seemed to be merit to both positions, and it was difficult to decide between them.",

I could imagine, for example, a key instrument failure in Chryse just after an unfortunate crash landing in Cydonia. To improve the Viking options, additional landing sites, geologically very different from Chryse and Cydonia, were selected in the radar certified region near 4 S latitude. A decision on whether Viking 2 would set down at high or at low latitude was not made until virtually the last minute, when a place with the hopeful name of Utopia, at the same latitude as Cydonia, was chosen. For Viking 1, the original landing site seemed, after we exam ined Orbiter photographs and late breaking Earth based radar data, unacceptably risky.",
    "chunk_378": "For a while I worried that Viking 1 had been condemned, like the legendary Flying Dutchman, to wan der the skies of Mars forever, never to find safe haven. Eventu ally we found a suitable spot, still in Chryse but far from the confluence of the four ancient channels.

But for so dangerous and mysterious a planet as Mars, there was also at least an element of luck. Immediately after landing, the first pictures were to be returned. We knew we had chosen dull places. But we could hope. The first picture taken by the Viking 1 lander was of one of its own footpads  in case it were to sink into Martian quicksand, we wanted to know about it before the spacecraft disappeared. The picture built up, line by line, until with enormous relief we saw the footpad sitting high and dry above the Martian surface.",
    "chunk_381": "Soon other pictures came into being, each picture element radioed individ ually back to Earth. I remember being transfixed by the first lander image to show the horizon of Mars.

There were rocks and sand drifts and a distant eminence, as natural and uns elfconscious as any landscape on Earth. Mars was a place.

Perhaps there are smaller forms in every rock and sand grain.

I once had a friend, an extraordinary microbiologist named Wolf Vishniac, of t he University of Rochester, in New York. In the late 1950s, when we were just beginning to think seriously about looking for life on Mars, he found himself at a scientific meeting where an astronomer expressed amazement that the biologists had no simple, reliable, automated instrument capable of looking for microorganisms. Vishniac decided he would do something about the matter. He developed a small device to be sent to the planets.",

But there was just a moment when resounding in my head was the distant echo of a word from my boyhood Barsoom. Blues for a Red Planet  226 friends called it the Wolf Trap. It would carry a little vial of nutrient organic matter to Mars, arrange for a sample of Martian soil to be mixed in with it, and observe the changing turbidity or cloudiness of the liquid as the Martian bugs if there were any grew if they would.",
    "chunk_389": "The Wolf Trap was selected along with three other microbiology experiments to go aboard the Viking landers. Two of the other three experiments also chose to send food to the Martians. The success of the Wolf Trap required that Martian bugs like liquid water. There were those who thought that Vishniac would only drown the little Martians. But the advantage of the Wolf Trap was that it laid no requirements on what the Martian microbes must do with their food. They had only to grow. All the other experiments made specific assumptions about gases that would be given off or taken in by the microbes, assumptions that were little more than guesses. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which runs the United States planetary space program, is subject to frequent and unpredictable budget cuts. Only rarely are there unanticipated budget increases.",
    "chunk_390": "NASA scientific activities have very little effective support in the government, and so science is most often the target when money needs to be taken away from NASA. In 1971 it was decided that one of the four microbiology experiments must be removed, and the Wolf Trap was offloaded. It was a crush ing disappointment for Vishniac, who had invested twelve years in its development. Many others in his place might have stalked off the Viking Biology Team. But Vishniac was a gentle and dedicated man. He decided instead that he could best serve the search for life on Mars by voyaging to the most Mars like environment on Earth  the dry va lleys of Antarctica.",
    "chunk_391": "Some previous investigators had examined Antarctic soil and decided that the few microbes they were able to find were not really natives of the dry valleys, but had been blown there from other, more clement environments. Recalling the Mars Jars experiments, Vishniac believed that life was tenacious and that Antarctica was perfectly consistent with microbiology. If terrestrial bugs could live on Mars, he thought, why not in Antarctica which was by and large warmer, wetter, and had more o xygen and much less ultraviolet light. Conversely, finding life in Antarctic dry valleys would correspondingly improve, he thought, the chances of life on Mars. Vishniac believed that the experimental techniques previously used to deduce no indigenous micr obes in Antarctica were flawed.

Because the design of space missions is finalized many years before launch, and because of Vishniacs death, the results of his Antarctic experiments did not influence the Viking design for seeking Martian life. In general, the microbiology experiments wer e not carried out at the low ambient Martian temperatures, and most did not provide long incubation times. They all made fairly strong assumptions about what Martian metabolism had to be like. There was no way to look for life inside the rocks.",
    "chunk_396": "Each Viking lander was equipped with a sample arm to acquire material from the surface and then slowly withdraw it into the innards of the spacecraft, transporting the particles on little hoppers like an electric train to five different experiments one on the inorganic chemistry of the soil, another to look for organic molecules in the sand and dust, and three to look for microbial life. When we look for life on a planet, we are making certain assumptions. We try, as well as we can, not to assume that life elsewhere will be just like life here. But there are limits to what we can do. We know in detail only about life here. While the Viking biology experiments are a pioneering first effort, they hardly represent a definitive search for life on Mars.",
    "chunk_397": "The results Blues for a Red Planet  229 have been tantalizing, annoying, provocative, stimulating, and, at least until recently, substantially inconclusive. Each of the three microbiology experiments asked a different kind of question, but in all cases a question about Martian metabolism. If there are microorganisms in the Martian soil, they must take in food and give off waste gases or they must take in gases from the atmosphere and, perhaps with the aid of sunlight, convert them into useful materials. So we bring food to Mars and hope that the Martians, if there are any, will find it tasty. Then we see if any interesting new gases come out of the soil. O r we provide our own radioactively labeled gases and see if they are converted into organic matter, in which case small Martians are inferred.",
    "chunk_398": "By criteria established before launch, two of the three Viking microbiology experiments seem to have yielded positive results. First, when Martian soil was mixed with a sterile organic soup from Earth, something in the soil chemically broke down the soup almost as if there were respiring microbes metabolizing a food package from Earth. Second, when gases from Earth were introduced into the Martian soil sample, the gases became chemically combined with the soil almost as if there were photo  synthesizing mic robes, generating organic matter from atmospheric gases. Positive results in Martian microbiology were achieved in seven different samplings in two locales on Mars separated by 5,000 kilometers. But the situation is complex, and the criteria of experimental success may have been inadequate. Enormous efforts were made to build the Viking microbiology experiments and test them with a variety of microbes.",
    "chunk_399": "Very little effort was made to calibrate the experiments with plausible inorganic Martian surface materials. Mars is not the Earth. As the legacy of Percival Lowell reminds us, we can be fooled. Perhaps there is an exotic inorganic chemistry in the Martian soil that is able by itself, in the absence of Martian microbes, to oxidize foodstuffs. Perhaps there is some special inorganic, nonliving catalyst in the soil that is able to fix atmospheric gases and convert them into organic molecules. Recent experiments suggest that this may indeed be the case. In the great Martian dust storm of 1971, spectral features of the dust were obtained by the Mariner 9 infrared spectrometer. In analyzing these spectra, O. B. Toon, J. B. Pollack and I found that certain features seem best accounted for by montmorillonite and other kinds of clay.",

It is too soon to say that all the Viking microbiology results can be explained by inorganic chemistry, but such a result would no longer be surprising. The clay hypothesis hardly excludes life on Mars, but it certainly carries us far enough to say that there is no compelling evidence for microbiology on Mars. Even so, the results of Banin and Rishpon are of great biological importance because they show that in the absence of life there can be a kind of soil chemistry that does some of the same things life does. On the Earth before life, there may already have b een chemical processes resembling respiration and photosynthesis cycling in the soil, perhaps to be incorporated by life once it arose. In addition, we know that montmorillonite clays are a potent catalyst for combining amino acids into longer chain molecu les resembling proteins.",
    "chunk_402": "The clays of the primitive Earth may have been the forge of life, and the chemistry of contemporary Mars may provide essential clues to the origin and early history of life on our planet. The Martian surface exhibits many impact craters, each named after a person, usually a scientist. Crater Vishniac lies appropriately in the Antarctic region of Mars. Vishniac did not claim that there had to be life on Mars, merely that it was possible, and that it was extraordinarily important to know if it was there. If life on Mars exists, we will have a unique opportunity to test the generality of our form of life. And if there is no life on Mars, a planet rather like the Earth, we must understand why because in that case, as Vishniac stressed, we have the classic scientific confrontation of the experiment and the control.",
    "chunk_403": "The finding that the Viking microbiology results can be explained by clays, that they need not imply life, helps to resolve another mystery the Viking organic chemistry experiment showed not a hint of organic matter in the Martian soil. If there is life o n Mars, where are the dead bodies? No organic molecules could be found no building blocks of proteins and nucleic acids, no simple hydrocarbons, nothing of the stuff of life on Earth. This is not necessarily a contradiction, because the Viking microbiology experiments are a thousand times more sensitive per equivalent carbon atom than the Viking chemistry experiments, and seem to detect organic matter synthesized in the Martian soil. But this does not leave much margin. Terrestrial soil is loaded with the organic remains of once living organisms Martian soil has less organic matter than the surface of the Moon.",
    "chunk_404": "If we held to the life hypothesis, we might suppose that the dead bodies have been destroyed by the chemically reactive, oxidizing surface of Mars like a germ in a bottle of hydrogen peroxide or that there is life, but of a kind in which organic chemistry plays a less central role than it does in life on Earth. But this last alternative seems to me to be special pleading I am, reluctantly, a self confessed carbon chauvinist.

If we did not know better, we might be tempted to take all the atoms that make us up, mix them together in a big container and stir. We can do this as much as we want. But in the end all we have is a tedious mix ture of atoms. How could we have expected anything else?",
    "chunk_408": "Harold Morowitz has calculated what it would cost to put together the correct molecular constituents that make up a human being by buying the molecules from chemical supply houses. The answer turns out to be about ten million dollars, which should make us all feel a little better. But even then we could not mix those chemicals together and h ave a human being emerge from the jar. That is far beyond our capability and will probably be so for a very long period of time. Fortunately, there are other less expens ive but still highly reliable methods of making human beings. I think the lifeforms on many worlds will consist, by and large, of the same atoms we have here, perhaps even many of the same basic molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids but put together in unfamiliar ways.",
    "chunk_409": "Perhaps organisms that float in dense pl anetary atmospheres will be very much like us in their atomic composition, except they might not have bones and therefore not need much calcium. Perhaps elsewhere some solvent other than water is used. Hydrofluoric acid might serve rather well, although th ere is not a great deal of fluorine in the Cosmos hydrofluoric acid would do a great deal of damage to the kind of molecules that make us up, but other organic molecules, paraffin waxes, for example, are perfectly stable in its presence. Liquid ammonia wo uld make an even better solvent system, because ammonia is very abundant in the Cosmos. But it is liquid only on worlds much colder than the Earth or Mars. Ammonia is ordinarily a gas on Earth, as water is on Venus.",

But these ideas do not rescue the notion that the Viking lander experiments indicate life on Mars.

The organic chemistry results, lik e the imaging and microbiology results, are all consistent with no life in the fine particles of Chryse and Utopia in the late 1970s.

We could even use Vishniacs scoring techniques. Although it would be fairly expensive, such a mission is probably within our technological capability. However, it carries with it a novel danger back contamina  tion. If we wish on Earth to examine samples of Martian soil for microbes, we must, of course, not sterilize the samples beforehand.

But we are not sure, and the stakes are high. If we wish to return unsterilized Martian samples to Earth, we must have a containment procedure that is stupefyingly reliable. There are nations that develop and stockpile bacteriological weapons. They seem to have an occasional accident, but th ey have not yet, so far as I know, produced global pandemics.

But in 1905, Einstein showed that the particle theory of light could explain the photoelectric effect, the ejection of electrons from a metal upon exposure to a beam of light. Modern quantum mechanics combines both ideas, and it is customary today to think of light as behaving in some circumstances as a beam of particles and in others as a wave.

We also know that partially surrounding Jupiter in the orbital position of Io was a great doughnut shaped tube of atoms, sulfur and sodium and potassium, material somehow lost from Io. When Voyager approached this giant moon we found a strange multicolored surface unlike any other in the solar system. Io is near the asteroid belt. It must have been thoroughly pum  meled throughout its history by falling boulders. Impact craters must have been made. Yet there were none to be seen. Accordingly, there had to be some process on Io that was extremely efficient in rubbing craters out or filling them in. The process could not be atmospheric, since Ios atmosphere has mostly escaped to space beca use of its low gravity.",

Linda Morabito, a member of the Voyager Navigation Team responsible for keeping Voyager precisely on its trajectory, was routinely ordering a computer to enhance an image of the edge of Io, to bring out the stars behind it. To her astonishment, she saw a b right plume standing off in the darkness from the satellites surface and soon determined that the plume was in exactly the position of one of the suspected volcanoes. Voyager had discovered the first active volcano beyond the Earth. We know now of nine lar ge volcanoes, spewing out gas and debris, and hundreds perhaps thousands of extinct volcanoes on Io.",
    "chunk_489": "The debris, rolling and flowing down the sides of the volcanic mountains, arching in great jets over the polychrome landscape, is more than enough to cover the impact craters. We are looking at a fresh planetary landscape, a surface newly hatched. How Galileo and Huygens would have marveled. The volcanoes of Io were predicted, before they were discovered, by Stanton Peale and his co workers, who calculated the tides that would be raised in the solid interior of Io by the combined pulls of the nearby moon Europa and the giant planet Jupiter. Th ey found that the rocks inside Io should have been melted, not by radioactivity but by tides that much of the interior of Io should be liquid. It now seems likely that the volcanoes of Io are tapping an underground ocean of liquid sulfur, melted and conce ntrated near the surface.",

The surface of Io is changing on a time scale of months. Maps will have to be issued regularly, like weather reports on Earth. Those future explorers on Io will have to keep their wits about them. The very thin and tenuous atmosphere of Io was found by Voyager to be composed mainly of sulfur dioxide. But this thin atmosphere can serve a useful purpose, because it may be just thick enough to protect the surface from the intense charged particles in t he Jupiter radiation belt in which Io is embedded.",
    "chunk_492": "At night the temperature drops so low that the sulfur dioxide should condense out as a kind of white frost the charged particles would then immolate the surface, and it would probably be wise to spend the nights just slightly underground. The great volcanic plumes of Io reach so high that they are close to injecting their atoms directly into the space around Jupiter. The volcanoes are the probable source of the great doughnut shaped ring of atoms that surrounds Jupiter in the position of Io s orbit. These atoms, gradually spiraling in toward Jupiter, should coat the inner moon Amalthea and may be responsible for its reddish coloration. It is even possible that the material outgassed from Io contributes, after many collisions and condensation s, to the ring system of Jupiter.",

As seen from the near sides of Io or Euro pa, that immense and variable world fills much of the sky, hanging aloft, never to rise or set, because almost every satellite in the solar system keeps a constant face to its planet, as the Moon does to the Earth. Jupiter will be a source of continuing pr ovocation and excitement for the future human explorers of the Jovian moons. As the solar system condensed out of interstellar gas and dust, Jupiter acquired most of the matter that was not ejected into interstellar space and did not fall inward to form the Sun.",

The largest planet is a star that failed. Even so, its interior temperatures are sufficiently high that it gives off about twice as much energy as it receives from the Sun. In the infrared part of the spectrum, it might even be correct to consider Jupiter a star. Had it become a star in visible light, we would today inhabit a binary or doublestar system, with two suns in our sky, and the nights would come more rarely a commonplace, I believe, in countless solar systems throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. We would doubtless think 284 Travelers Tales  the circumstances natural and lovely.",
    "chunk_495": "Deep below the clouds of Jupiter the weight of the overlying layers of atmosphere produces pressures much higher than any found on Earth, pressures so great that electrons are squeezed off hydrogen atoms, producing a remarkable substance, liquid metallic h ydrogen a physical state that has never been observed in terrestrial laboratories, because the requisite pressures have never been achieved on Earth. There is some hope that metallic hydrogen is a superconductor at moderate temperatures. If it could be ma nufactured on Earth, it would work a revolution in electronics. In the interior of Jupiter, where the pressures are about three million times the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the Earth, there is almost nothing but a great dark sloshing ocean of metallic hydrogen.",
    "chunk_496": "But at the very core of Jupiter there may be a lump of rock and iron, an Earth like world in a pressure vise, hidden forever at the center of the largest planet. The electrical currents in the liquid metal interior of Jupiter may be the source of the planets enormous magnetic field, the largest in the solar system, and of its associated belt of trapped electrons and protons. These charged particles are ejected fro m the Sun in the solar wind and captured and accelerated by Jupiters magnetic field. Vast numbers of them are trapped far above the clouds and are condemned to bounce from pole to pole until by chance they encounter some high  altitude atmospheric molecule and are removed from the radiation belt.",
    "chunk_497": "Io moves in an orbit so close to Jupiter that it plows through the midst of this intense radiation, creating cascades of charged particles, which in turn generate violent bursts of radio energy. They may also influence eruptive processes on the surface of Io. It is possible to predict radio bursts from Jupiter with better reliability than weather forecasts on Earth, by computing the position of Io. That Jupiter is a source of radio emission was discovered accidentally in the 1950s, the early days of radio astronomy. Two young Americans, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin, were examining the sky with a newly constructed and for that time very sensiti ve radio telescope. They were searching the cosmic radio background that is, radio sources far beyond our solar system.",

Jupiter and its moons are a kind of miniature solar system of diverse and exquisite worlds with much to teach us. In composition and in many other respects Saturn is similar to Jupiter, although smaller. Rotating once every ten hours, it exhibits colorful equatorial banding, which is, however, not so prominent as Jupiters.",

The most interesting of the moons of Saturn seems to be Titan, the largest moon in the solar system and the only one with a substantial atmosphere. Prior to the encounter of Voyager 1 with Titan in November 1980, our information about Titan was scanty and tantalizing. The only gas known unambiguously to be pres ent was methane, CH 4, discovered by G. P. Kuiper. Ultraviolet light from the 286 sun converts methane to more complex hydrocarbon molecules and hydrogen gas. The hydrocarbons should remain on Titan, covering the surface with a brownish tarry organic sludge, something like that produced in experiments on the origin of life on Earth.",
    "chunk_503": "The lightweight hydrogen gas should, because of Titans low gravity, rapidly escape to space by a violent process known as blowoff, which should carry the methane and other atmospheric constituents with it. But Titan 287 Travelers Tales  has an atmospheric pressure at least as great as that of the planet Mars. Blowoff does not seem to be happening. Perhaps there is some major and as yet undiscovered atmospheric constituent  nitrogen, for example which keeps the average molecular weight of the atmosphere high and prevents blowoff. Or perhaps blowoff is happening, but the gases lost to space are being replenished by others released from the satellites interior. The bulk density of Titan is so low that there must be a vast supply of water and other ices, probably including methane, which are at unknown rates being released to the surface by internal heating.",

    "chunk_505": "Most students of Titan agree that complex organic molecules are the most likely explanation. The surface temperature and atmospheric thickness are still under debate. There have been som e hints of an enhanced surface temperature due to an atmospheric greenhouse effect. With abundant organic molecules on its surface and in its atmosphere, Titan is a remarkable and unique denizen of the solar system. The history of our past voyages of disco very suggests that Voyager and other spacecraft reconnaissance missions will revolutionize our knowledge of this place. Through a break in the clouds of Titan, you might glimpse Saturn and its rings, their pale yellow color diffused by the intervening atmosphere.",
    "chunk_506": "Because the Saturn system is ten times farther from the Sun than is the Earth, the sunshine on Titan is only 1 p ercent as intense as we are accustomed to, and the temperatures should be far below the freezing point of water even with a sizable atmospheric greenhouse effect. But with abundant organic matter, sunlight and perhaps volcanic hot spots, the possibility of life on Titan cannot be readily dismissed. In that very different environment, it would, of course, have to be very different from life on Earth. There is no strong evidence either for or against life on Titan. It is merely possible. We are unlikely to d etermine the answer to this question without landing instrumented space vehicles on the Titanian surface.",
    "chunk_507": "To examine the individual particles composing the rings of Saturn, we must approach them closely, for the particles are small snowballs and ice chips and tiny tumbling bonsai glaciers, a meter or so across. We know they are composed of water ice, because t he spectral properties of sunlight reflected off the rings match those of ice in the laboratory measurements. To approach the particles in a space vehicle, we must slow down, so that we move along with them as they circle Saturn at some 45,000 miles per ho ur that is, we must be in orbit around Saturn ourselves, moving at the same speed as the particles.

Although the whole assemblage is tearing around the planet itself at some 20 kilometers per second, the relative speed of two adjacent particles is very low, only some few centimete rs per minute. Because of this relative motion, the particles can never stick together by their mutual gravity. As soon as they try, their slightly different orbital speeds pull them apart. If the rings were not so close to Saturn, this effect would not be so strong, and the particles could accrete, making small snowballs and eventually growing into satellites.",
    "chunk_512": "So it is probably no coincidence that outside the rings of Saturn there is a system of satellites varying in size from a few hundred kilometers acro ss to Titan, a giant moon nearly as large as the planet Mars. The matter in all the satellites and the planets themselves may have been originally distributed in the form of rings, which condensed and accumulated to form the present moons and planets. For Saturn as for Jupiter, the magnetic field captures and accelerates the charged particles of the solar wind. When a charged particle bounces from one magnetic pole to the other, it must cross the equatorial plane of Saturn. If there is a ring particle i n the way, the proton or electron is absorbed by this small snowball.",
    "chunk_513": "As a result, for both planets, the rings clear out the radiation belts, which exist only interior and exterior to the particle rings. A close moon of Jupiter or Saturn will likewise gobb le up radiation belt particles, and in fact one of the new moons of Saturn was discovered in just this way Pioneer 11 found an unexpected gap in the radiation belts, caused by the sweeping up of charged particles by a previously unknown moon.

I felt a kind of sorrow for them a commonplace whose strangeness remained somehow hidden from my incurious fellows. There had to be some deeper answer. As soon as I was old enough, my parents gave me my first library card. I think the library was on 85th Street, an alien land. Immediately, I asked the librarian for something on stars.

    "chunk_520": "I complained, and for some reason then obscure to me, she smiled and found another book  the right kind of book. I opened it breathlessly and read until I found it. The book said something astonishing, a very big thought. It said that the stars were suns, only very far away. The Sun was a star, but close up. Imagine that you took the Sun and moved it so far away that it was just a tiny twinkling point of light. How far away would you have to move it? I was innocent of the notion of angular size. I was ignorant of the inverse square law for light propagation. I had not a ghost of a chance of calculating the distance to the stars.",

They also go around the Sun some are closer to it and some are farther away. But the planets do not shine by their own light, as the Sun does. They merely reflect light from the Sun. If you were a great distance away, you would not see the Earth and the other planets at all they would be only faint luminous points, lost in the glare of the Sun.",

Everything, he said, is a collection of atoms, intricately assembled. Even we. Nothing exists, he said, but atoms and t he void. When we cut an apple, the knife must pass through empty spaces between the atoms, Democritus argued.

The slope of the cone forces one side of the slice to have a slightly smaller cross section than the other. If the two areas were exactly equal, we would have a cylinder, not a cone. No matter how sharp the knife, the two pieces have unequal cross sections. Why? Because, on the scale of the very small, matter exhibits some irreducible roughness.

He had stated the problem that, in mathematics, is called the theo ry of limits. He was knocking at the door of the differential and integral calculus, that fundamental tool for understanding the world that was not, so far as we know from written records, in fact discovered until the time of Isaac Newton.

Beyond the Milk of Hera, past the Backbone of Night, the mind of Democritus soared. As a person, Democritus seems to have been somewhat unusual.

Anaxagoras believed in a special mind substance and disbelieved i n the existence of atoms. He thought humans were more intelligent than other animals because of our hands, a very Ionian idea. He was the first person to state clearly that the Moon shines by reflected light, and he accordingly devised a theory of the phases of the Moon. This doctrine was so dangerous that the manuscript describing it had to be circulated in secret, an Athenian samizdat . It was not in keeping with the prejudices of the time to explain the phases or eclipses of the Moon by the relative geometry of the Earth, the Moon and the self luminous Sun.",
    "chunk_572": "Aristotle, two generations later, was content to argue that those things happened because it was the nature of the Moon to have phases and eclipses mere verbal juggling, an explanation that explains nothing. The prevailing belief was that the Sun and Moon were gods. Anaxagoras held that the Sun and stars are fiery stones. We do not feel the heat of the stars because they are too far away. He also thought that the Moon has mountains right and inhabitants wrong. He held that the Sun was so huge that it was probably larger than the Peloponnesus, roughly the southern third of Greece. His critics thought this estimate excessive and absurd. Anaxagoras was brought to Athens by Pericles, its leader in its time of greatest glory, but also the man whose actions led to the Peloponnesian War, which destroyed Athenian democracy.",

There are those who think that in this role Anaxagoras contributed significantly to the greatness of Athens. But Pericles had political problems. He was too p owerful to be attacked directly, so his enemies attacked those close to him. Anaxagoras was convicted and imprisoned for the religious crime of impiety because he had taught that the Moon was made of ordinary matter, that it was a place, and that the Sun w as a red hot stone in the sky.

Instead, the old Ionians represent a different and largely contradictory tradition, one in much better accord with modern science.

According to local tradition, he lived for a time in a cave on the Samian Mount Kerkis, and was the first person in the history of the world to deduce that the Earth is a sphere. Perhaps he argued by analogy with the Moon and the Sun, or noticed the curved shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, or recognized that when ships leave Samos and recede over the ho rizon, their masts disappear last. He or his disciples discovered the Pythagorean theorem the sum of the squares of the shorter sides of a right triangle equals the square of the longer side.

It was he who first used the word Cosmos to denote a well ordered and harmonious universe, a world amenable to hu man understanding.

However, Pythagoras employed a very different method. He taught that the laws of Nature could be dedu ced by pure thought.

It was in striking contrast to the messy reality of the workaday world. They believed that in their mathematics they had glimpsed a perfect reality, a realm of the gods, of which our familiar world is but an imperfect reflection. In Platos famous parable of the cave, prisoners were imagined tied in such a way that they saw only the shadows of passersby and believed the shadows to be real never guessing the complex reality that was accessible if they would but turn their heads.

Indeed, the authority of those who profess to teach is often a positive hin drance to those who desire to learn they cease to employ their own judgment, and take what they perceive to be the verdict of their chosen master as settling the question. In fact I am not disposed to approve the practice traditionally ascribed to the Pythagoreans, who, when questioned as to the grounds of any assertion that they advanced in debate, are said to have been accustomed to reply The Master said so, the Master being Pythagoras. So potent was an opinion already decided, making authority preva il unsupported by reason.",
    "chunk_581": "The Pythagoreans were fascinated by the regular solids, symmetrical three dimensional objects all of whose sides are the same regular polygon. The cube is the simplest example, having six squares as sides. There are an infinite number of regular polygons, but only five regular solids. The proof of this statement, a famous example of mathematical reasoning, is given in Appendix 2. For some reason, knowledge of a solid called the dodecahedron having twelve pentagons as sides seemed to them dangerous. It was mystically associated with the Cosmos. The other denied by Aristotle, who placed intelligence in the heart, and then revived by Herophilus of Chalcedon. He also founded the science of embryology.

Ordinary people were to be kept ignorant of the dodecahedron. important mathematical discoveries, the Pythagoreans sup were also deemed perfect. The pros and cons of the Pythagorean tradition can be seen clearly in the lifes work of Johannes Kepler Chapter 3. The Pythagorean idea of a perfect and mystical world, unseen by the senses, was readily accepted by the early Christians and was an integr al component of Keplers early training.",

Kepler w as both inspired in his search for the harmony of planetary motion and delayed for more than a decade by the attractions of Pythagorean doctrine. A disdain for the practical swept the ancient world. Plato urged astronomers to think about the heavens, but not to waste their time observing them.

Plutarch wrote It does not of necessity follow that, if the work delight you with its grace, the one who wrought it is worthy of esteem. Xenophons opinion was What are called the mechanical arts carry a social stigma and are rightly dishonoured in our cities. As a result of such attitudes, the brilliant and promising Ionian experimental method was largely abandoned for two thousand years. Without experiment, there is no way to choose among contending hypotheses, no way for science to advance. The antiempirical taint of the Pythagoreans survives to this day. But why? Where did this distaste for experiment come from? An explanation for the decline of ancient science has been put forward by the historian of science, Benjamin Farrington The mercantile tradition, which led to Ionian science, also led to a slave economy.",
    "chunk_586": "The owning of slaves was the road to wealth and pow er. Polycrates fortifications were built by slaves. Athens in the time of Pericles, Plato and Aristotle had a vast slave population. All the brave Athenian talk about democracy applied only to a privileged few. What slaves characteristically perform is ma nual labor. But scientific experimentation is manual labor, from which the slaveholders are preferentially distanced while it is only the slaveholders politely called gentle men in some societies who have the leisure to do science. Accordingly, almost n o one did science. The Ionians were perfectly able to make machines of some elegance. But the availability of slaves undermined the economic motive for the development of technology. Thus the mercantile tradition contributed to the great Ionian awakening a round 600 B.C., and, through slavery, may have been the cause of its decline some two centuries later.",
    "chunk_587": "There are great ironies here. Similar trends are apparent throughout the world. The high point in indigenous Chinese astronomy occurred around 1280, with the 330  Cosmos work of Kuo Shou ching, who used an observational baseline of 1,500 years and improved both astronomical instruments 331 The Backbone of Night  and mathematical techniques for computation. It is generally thought that Chinese astronomy thereafter underwent a steep decline. Nathan Sivin believes that the reason lies at least partly in increasing rigidity of elite attitudes, so that the educated we re less inclined to be curious about techniques and less willing to value science as an appropriate pursuit for a gentleman. The occupation of astronomer became a hereditary office, a practice inconsistent with the advance of the subject.",

Perhaps science was stillborn in Indian, Mayan and Aztec civilizations for the same reason it declined in Ionia, the pervasiveness of the slave economy. A major problem in the contemporary political Third World is that the educated classes tend to be the children of the wealthy, with a vested interest in the status quo, and are unaccustomed either to working with their hands or to challenging conventional wisdom.

All we know is from fragmen ts, chiefly on ethics, and secondhand accounts. The same is true of almost all the other ancient Ionian scientists. In the recognition by Pythagoras and Plato that the Cosmos is knowable, that there is a mathematical underpinning to nature, they greatly advanced the cause of science. But in the suppression of disquieting facts, the sense that science should be kept for a small elite, the distaste for experiment, the embrace of mysticism and the easy acceptance of slave societies, they set back the human enterprise. After a long mystical sleep in which the tools of scientific inquiry lay moldering, the Ionian approach, in some cases transmitted through scholars at the Alexandrian Library, was finally rediscovered. The Western world reawakened.",
    "chunk_591": "Experiment and open inquiry became once more respectable. Forgotten books and fragments were again read. Leonardo and Columbus and Copernicus were inspired by or independently retraced parts of this ancient Greek tradition. There is in our time much Ionian science, although not in politics and religion, and a fair amount of courageous free inquiry. But there are also appalling superst itions and deadly ethical ambiguities. We are flawed by ancient contradictions. The Platonists and their Christian successors held the peculiar notion that the Earth was tainted and somehow nasty, while the heavens were perfect and divine. The fundamental idea that the Earth is a planet, that we are citizens of the Universe, was rejec ted and forgotten. This idea was first argued by Aristarchus, born on Samos three centuries after Pythagoras. Aristarchus was one of the last of the Ionian scientists.",
    "chunk_592": "By this time, the center of intellectual enlightenment had moved to the great Library of Alexandria. Aristarchus was the first person to hold that the Sun rather than the Earth is at the center of the planetary system, that all the planets go around the Sun rather than the Earth. Typi  cally, his writings on this matter are lost. From the size of the Earths shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, he deduced that the Sun 333  Cosmos had to be much larger than the Earth, as well as very far away. He may then have reasoned that it is absurd for so large a body as the Sun to revolve around so small a body as the Earth. He put the Sun at the center, made the Earth rotate on its axis 334 The Backbone of Night  once a day and orbit the Sun once a year.",
    "chunk_593": "It is the same idea we associate with the name of Copernicus, whom Galileo described as the restorer and confirmer, not the inventor, of the heliocentric hypothesis. For most of the 1,800 years between Aristarchus and Copernicus nobody knew the correct disposition of the planets, even though it had been laid out perfectly clearly around 280 B.C. The idea outraged some of Aristarchus contemporaries. There were cries, like those voiced about Anaxagoras and Bruno and Galileo, that he be condemned for impie ty. The resistance to Aristarchus and Copernicus, a kind of geocentrism in everyday life, remains with us we still talk about the Sun rising and the Sun setting. It is 2,200 years since Aristarchus, and our language still pretends that the Earth does not turn.",

It was natural to think of the solar system as much more compact and local. If I hold my finger before my eyes and examine it first with my left and then with my right eye, it seems to move against the distant background. The closer my finger is, the more it seems to move. I can estimate the distance to my finger from the amount of this apparent motion, or parallax. If my eyes were farther apart, my finger would seem to move substantially more.",
    "chunk_595": "The longer the baseline from which we make our two obs ervations, the greater the parallax and the better we can measure the distance to remote objects. But we live on a moving platform, the Earth, which every six months has progressed from one end of its orbit to the other, a distance of 300,000,000 kilometer s. If we look at the same unmoving celestial object six months apart, we should be able to measure very great distances. Aristarchus suspected the stars to be distant suns. He placed the Sun among the fixed stars. The absence of detectable stellar parallax as the Earth moved suggested that the stars were much farther away than the Sun. Before the invention of the telescope, the parallax of even the nearest stars was too small to detect. Not until the nineteenth century was the parallax of a star first measured.",
    "chunk_596": "It then became clear, from straightforward Greek geometry, that the stars were light years away. Copernicus may have gotten the idea from reading about Aristarchus. Recently discovered classical texts were a source of great excitement in Italian universities when Copernicus went to medical school there. In the 335 manuscript of his book, Copernicus mentioned Aristarchus priority, but he omitted the citation before the book saw print. Copernicus wrote in a letter to Pope Paul III According to Cicero, Nicetas had thought the Earth was moved . . . According to Pluta rch who discusses Aristarchus . . . certain others had held the same opinion.

There is another way to measure the distance to the stars which the Ionians were fully capable of discovering, although, so far as we know, they did not employ it. Everyone knows that the farther away an object is, the smaller it seems. This inverse propor tionality between apparent size and distance is the basis of perspective in art and photography. So the farther away we are from the Sun, the smaller and dimmer it appears. How far would we have to be from the Sun for it to appear as small and as dim as a star? Or, equivalently, how small a piece of the Sun would be as bright as a star?",
    "chunk_598": "An early experiment to answer this question was performed by Christiaan Huygens, very much in the Ionian tradition. Huygens drilled small holes in a brass plate, held the plate up to the Sun and asked himself which hole seemed as bright as he remembered th e bright star Sirius to have been the night before. The hole was effectively 128,000 the apparent size of the Sun. So Sirius, he reasoned, must be 28,000 times farther from us than the Sun, or about half a light year away. It is hard to remember just how bright a star is many hours after you look at it, but Huygens remembered very well. If he had known that Sirius was intrinsically brighter than the Sun, he would have come up with almost exactly the right answer Sirius is 8.8 lightyears away.",
    "chunk_599": "The fact t hat Aristarchus and Huygens used imprecise data and derived imperfect answers hardly matters. They explained their methods so clearly that, when better observations were available, more accurate answers could be derived. Between the times of Aristarchus and Huygens, humans answered the question that had so excited me as a boy growing up in Brooklyn What are the stars? The answer is that the stars are mighty suns, light  years away in the vastness of interstellar space. The great legacy of Aristarchus is this neither we nor our planet enjoys a privileged position in Nature. This insight has since been applied upward to the stars, and sideways to many subsets of the human family, with great success and invariable oppositi on. It has been responsible for major advances in astronomy, physics, biology, anthropology, economics and politics.",

At the end of the eighteenth century, William Herschel, musician and astronomer to George III of England, completed a project to map the starry skies and found apparently equal numbers of stars in all directions in the plane or band of the Milky Way from this, reasonably enough, he deduced that we were at the center of the Galaxy.

By comparing the faintness of such stars when found in globular clusters with their real brightness, as determined from nearby representatives, Shapley could calculate how far away they are  just as, in a field, we can estimate the distance of a lant ern of known intrinsic brightness from the feeble light that reaches us essentially, the method of Huygens.",

It seemed to him very likely that the globular clusters used in this investigation, nearly a hundred of them, would be orbiting about, paying homage to, the massive center of the Milky Way. Shapley had in 1915 the courage to propose that the solar system was in the outskirts and not near the core of our galaxy. Herschel had been misled because of the copious amount of obscuring dust in the direction of Sagittarius he had no way to know of th e enormous numbers of stars beyond.",

Such beings may pity us for our handful of naked eye stars, because their skies will be ablaze with them.

Astronomically, the U.S.S.R. and the United States are the same place. The stars in any constellation are all so far away that we cannot recognize them as a three dimensional configuration as long as we are tied to Earth. The average distance between the stars is a few light years, a light year being, we remember, about ten trillion kilometers.",
    "chunk_614": "For the patterns of the constellations to change, we must travel over distances comparable to those that separate the stars we must venture across the light years. Then some nearby stars will seem to move out of the constellation, others will enter it, and its configuration will alter dramatically. Our technology is, so far, utterly incapable of such grand interstellar voyages, at least in reasonable transit times. But our computers can be taught the three dimensional positions of all the nearby stars, and we can ask to be taken on a little trip a circumnavigation of the collection of bright stars that constitute the Big Dipper, say and watch the constellations change. We connect the stars in typical constellations, in the usual celestial follow thedots drawings. As we change our perspective, we see their apparent shapes distort severely.",

Perhaps sometime in the next few centuries a spaceship from Earth will actually travel such distances at some 348 Travels in Space and Time  remarkable speed and see new constellations that no human has ever viewed before except with such a computer. The appearance of the constellations changes not only in space but also in time not only if we alter our position but also if we merely wait sufficiently long. Sometimes stars move together in a group or cluster other times a single star may move very ra pidly with respect to its fellows. Eventually such stars leave an old constellation and enter a new one.",
    "chunk_616": "Occasionally, one member of a double star system explodes, breaking the gravitational shackles that bound its companion, which then leaps into space at its former orbital velocity, a slingshot in the sky. In addition, stars are born, stars evolve, and stars die. If we wait long enough, new stars appear and old stars vanish. The patterns in the sky slowly melt and alter. Even over the lifetime of the human species a few million years  constellations have been changing. Consider the present configuration of the Big Dipper, or Great Bear. Our computer can carry us in time as well as in space. As we run the Big Dipper backward s into the past, allowing for the motion of its stars, we find quite a different appearance a million years ago. The Big Dipper then looked quite a bit like a spear.",
    "chunk_617": "If a time machine dropped you precipitously in some unknown age in the distant past, you c ould in principle determine the epoch by the configuration of the stars If the Big Dipper is a spear, this must be the Middle Pleistocene. We can also ask the computer to run a constellation forward into time. Consider Leo the Lion. The zodiac is a band of twelve constellations seemingly wrapped around the sky in the apparent annual path of the Sun through the heavens. The root of the word is that for zoo, because the zodiacal constellations, like Leo, are mainly fancied to be animals. A million years from now, Leo will look still less like a lion than it does today.",
    "chunk_618": "Perhaps our remote descendants will call it the constellation of the radio te lescope although I suspect a million years from now the radio telescope will have become more obsolete than the stone spear is now. The nonzodiacal constellation of Orion, the hunter, is outlined by four bright stars and bisected by a diagonal line of three stars, which represent the belt of the hunter. Three dimmer stars hanging from the belt are, according to the conventional astro nomical projective test, Orions sword. The middle star in the sword is not actually a star but a great cloud of gas called the Orion Nebula, in which stars are being born. Many of the stars in Orion are hot and young, evolving rapidly and ending their liv es in colossal cosmic explosions called supernovae. They are born and die in periods of tens of millions of years.",

At some positions in its orbit, Proxima is the closest known star to the Sun  hence its name. Most stars in the sky are members of double or multiple star systems. Our solitary Sun is something of an anomaly. The second brightest star in the constellation Andromeda, called Beta Andromedae, is seventy five light years away. The light by which we see it now has spent seventy five years traversing the dark of interstellar space on its long journey to Earth. In the unlikely event that Beta Andromedae blew itself up last Tuesday, we would not know it for another seventy five years, as this interesting information, traveling at the speed of light, would require seventy five years to cross the enormous interstellar distances.",

Space and time are interwoven. We cannot look out into space without looking back into time. Light travels very fast. But space is very empty, and the stars are far apart. Distances of seventy  five light years or less are very small compared to other dist ances in astronomy. From the Sun to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy is 30,000 light years. From our galaxy to the nearest spiral galaxy, M31, also in the constellation Andromeda, is 2,000,000 light years.

On the other hand, when we look at a quasar eight billion lightyears away, the fact that we are seeing it as it was eight billion years ago may be very important. For example, there are those who think that quasars are explosive events likely to happen only in the early history of 350 galaxies. In that case, the more distant the galaxy, the earlier in its history we are observing it, 351 Travels in Space and Time  and the more likely it is that we should see it as a quasar. Indeed, the number of quasars increases as we look to distances of more than about five billion light years.",

They would need 40,000 years to go the distance to the nearest star. Do we have any hope of leaving Earth and traversing the immense distances even to Proxima Centauri in convenient periods of time? Can we do something to approach the speed of light? What is magic about the speed of light? Might we someday be able to go faster than that? If you had walked through the pleasant Tuscan countryside in the 1890s, you might have come upon a somewhat long haired teenage high school dropout on the road to Pavia.

His name was Albert Einstein, and his ruminations changed the world. Einstein had been fascinated by Bernsteins Peoples Book of Natural Science , a popularization of science that described on its very first page the astonishing speed of electricity through wires and light through space. He wondered what the world would look like if you could travel on a wave of light. To travel at the speed of ligh t!

Something strange happens at the speed of light. The more Einstein thought about such questions, the more troubling they became. Paradoxes seemed to emer ge everywhere if you could travel at the speed of light. Certain ideas had been accepted as true without sufficiently careful thought. Einstein posed simple questions that could have been asked centuries earlier. For example, what do we mean when we say th at two events are simultaneous? Imagine that I am riding a bicycle toward you. As I approach an intersection I nearly collide, so it seems to me, with a horse  drawn cart. I swerve and barely avoid being run over.",

Could I experience a near collision with the cart while you perhaps see me swerve around nothing and pedal cheerfully on toward the town of Vinci? These are curious and subtle questions. They challenge the obvious . There is a reason that no one thought of them before Einstein. From such elementary questions, Einstein produced a fundamental rethinking of the world, a revolution in physics. If the world is to be understood, if we are to avoid such logical paradoxes when traveling at high speeds, there are some rules, commandments of Nature, that must be obeyed.",
    "chunk_629": "Einstein codified these rules in the special theory of relativity. Light reflected or emitted from an object travels at the same velocity whether the object is moving or stationary Thou shalt not add thy speed to the speed of light . Also, no material object may move faster than light Thou shalt not travel at or beyond the speed of l ight. Nothing in physics prevents you from traveling as close to the speed of light as you like 99.9 percent of the speed of light would be just fine. But no matter how hard you try, you can never gain that last decimal point. For the world to be logically con sistent, there must be a cosmic speed limit. Otherwise, you could get to any speed you wanted by adding velocities on a moving platform.",

The resolution of the paradox is that the velocity of light must be indepen dent of the velocity of the moving object. application of the ideas of Aristarchus and Copernicus was rejected or ignored.

This is what the word relativity means. The idea is very simple, despite its magical trappings in viewing th e universe, every place is as good as every other place. The laws of Nature must be identical no matter who is describing them. If this is to be true and it would be stunning if there were something special about our insignificant location in the Cosmos then it follows that no one may travel faster than light.

And there are no phenomena in our experience like the crack of the bullwhip or the clap of 354 Travels in Space and Time  thunder for sound to suggest the possibility of traveling in a vacuum faster than light. On the contrary, there is an extremely wide range of experience with nuclear accelerators and atomic clocks, for example in precise quantitative agreement with special relativity. The problems of simultaneity do not apply to sound as they do to light because sound is propagated through some material medium, usually air.",
    "chunk_634": "The sound wave that reaches you when a friend is talking is the motion of molecules in the air. Light, however, tr avels in a vacuum. There are restrictions on how molecules of air can move which do not apply to a vacuum. Light from the Sun reaches us across the intervening empty space, but no matter how carefully we listen, we do not hear the crackle of sunspots or th e thunder of the solar flares. It was once thought, in the days before relativity, that light did propagate through a special medium that permeated all of space, called the lumin  iferous aether. But the famous Michelson Morley experiment demonstrated th at such an aether does not exist. We sometimes hear of things that can travel faster than light. Something called the speed of thought is occasionally proffered.",
    "chunk_635": "This is an exceptionally silly notion especially since the speed of impulses through the neurons in our brains is about the sa me as the speed of a donkey cart. That human beings have been clever enough to devise relativity shows that we think well, but I do not think we can boast about thinking fast. The electrical impulses in modern computers do, however, travel nearly at the sp eed of light. Special relativity, fully worked out by Einstein in his middle twenties, is supported by every experiment performed to check it. Perhaps tomorrow someone will invent a theory consistent with everything else we know that circumvents paradoxes on such matter s as simultaneity, avoids privileged reference frames and still permits travel faster than light. But I doubt it very much. Einsteins prohibition against traveling faster than light may clash with our common sense.",

Relativity does set limits on what humans can ultimately do. But the universe is not required to be in perfect harmony with hu man ambition. Special relativity removes from our grasp one way of reaching the stars, the ship that can go faster than light. Tantalizingly, it suggests another and quite unexpected method.

They are also consistent with many experiments. Very accurate clocks carried in airplanes slow down a little compared to stationary clocks. Nuclear accelerators are desi gned to allow for the increase of mass with increasing speed if they were not designed in this way, accelerated particles would all smash into the walls of the apparatus, and there would be little to do in experimental nuclear physics.

For the ramjet to work, it needs a frontal scoop hundreds of kilometers across.

The Earth gravitationally attracts us with a certain force, which if we are falling we experience as an acceleration.

A falling rock will reach a speed of 10 meters per second after one second of fall, 20 meters per second after two seconds, and so on until it strikes the ground or is slowed by friction with the air.

The acceleration due to gravity should always be written with a lowercase g, to distinguish it from the Newtonian gravita tional constant, G, which is a measure of the strength of gravity everywhere in the universe, not merely on whatever world or sun we are discussing. The Newtonian relationship of the two quantities is F  mg  GMmr2 g  GMr2, where F is the gravitational force, M is the mass of the planet or star, m is the mass of the falling object, and r is the distance from the falling object to the center of the planet or star.",

For white dwarfs, the pressure of the electrons, stripped from their nuclei, holds the star up. For neutron stars, the pressure of the neutrons staves off gravity.

Then, to the astonishment of many, including many astronomers, evidence was actually found for the existence of black holes in space. The Earths atmosphere is opaque to Xrays. To determine whether astronomical objects emit such short wavelengths of light, an X ray telescope must be carried aloft.",

In 1971, Uhuru discovered a remarkably bright X ray source in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan, flickering on and off a thousand times a second. The source, called Cygnus X l, must therefore be very small. Whatever the reason for the flicker, information on when to turn on and off can cross Cyg X l no faster than the speed of light, 300,000 kmsec. Thus Cyg X l can be no larger 420 than 300,000 kmsec  11000 sec  300 kilometers across.

The companions mass is about ten times that of the Sun. The supergiant is an unlikely source of X rays, and it is tempting to identify the companion inferred in visible light with the sou rce detected in X ray light. But an invisible object weighing ten times more than the Sun and collapsed into a volume the size of an asteroid can only be a black hole. The X rays are plausibly generated by friction in the disk of gas and dust accreted arou nd Cyg X l from its supergiant companion.",

Perhaps, as I. S. Shklovskii has suggested, there is a black hole hiding there, which ate the exploding stellar core and damped the fires of the supernova. Telescopes in space are the means for checking these shards and fragments of data that may be the spoor, the trail, of the legendary black hole. A helpful way to understand black holes is to think about the curvature of space. Consider a flat, flexible, lined two dimensional surface, like a piece of graph paper made of rubber. If we drop a small mass, the surface is deformed or puckered.",

In our example, we see two dimensional space warped by mass into a third physical dim ension. Imagine we live in a three  dimensional universe, locally distorted by matter into a fourth physical dimension that we cannot perceive directly. The greater the local mass, the more intense the local gravity, and the more severe the pucker, distorti on or warp of space. In this analogy, a black hole is a kind of bottomless pit.

It was not that all the matter and energy were squeezed into a minor corner of the present universe rather, the entire universe, matter and energy and the space they fill, occupied a very small volume.

As space stretched, the matter and energy in the universe expanded with it and rapidly co oled.

We have never seen a galaxy change its form significantly only because it takes so long to move. The Milky Way rotates once every quarter billion years. If we were to speed the rotation, we would see that the Galaxy is a dynamic, almost organic entity, in some way s resembling a multi cellular organism. Any astronomical photograph of a galaxy is merely a snapshot of one stage in its ponderous motion and evolution. The inner region of a galaxy rotates as a solid body. But, beyond that, like the planets around the Sun following Keplers third law, the outer provinces rotate progressively more slowly.",

These stars shine for ten million years or so, a period corresponding to only 5 percent of a galactic rotation. But as the stars that outline a spiral arm burn out, new stars and their associated nebulae are formed just behind them, and the spiral pattern persists. The stars that outline the arms do not survive even a single galactic rotation only the spiral pattern remains. 438  This is not quite true.",

The Sun has been in and out of spiral arms often in the twenty times it has gone around the Milky Way at 200 kilometers per second roughly half a million miles per hour. On the average, the Sun and the planets spend forty million years in a spiral arm, eighty million outside, another forty million in, and so on. Spiral arms outline the region where the latest crop of newly hatched stars is being formed, but not necessarily where such middle aged stars as the Sun happen to be.",

About ten million years ago, the Sun emerged from the Gould Belt complex of the Orion Spiral Arm, which is now a little less than a thousand light years away. Interior to the Orion arm is the Sagittarius arm beyond the Orion arm is the Perseus arm. When the Sun passes through a spiral arm it is more likely than it is at present to enter into gaseous nebulae and interstellar dust clouds and to encounter objects of substellar mass. It has been suggested that the major ice ages on our planet, which recur every hundred million years or so, may be due to the interposi tion of interstellar matter between the Sun and the Earth.",

The relative abundance of magnesium isotopes all sharing the same number of protons, but having differing numbers of neutrons depends on the precise sequence of stellar nucleosynthetic events, including the timing of nearby supernova explosions, that produced any particular sample of magnesium. In a different corner of the Galaxy, a different sequence of events should have occurred and a different ratio of magnesium isotopes should prevail.",
    "chunk_794": "The discovery of the Big Bang and the recession of the galaxies came from a commonplace of nature called the Doppler ef fect. We are used to it in the physics of sound. An automobile driver speeding by us blows his horn. Inside the car, the driver hears a steady blare at a fixed pitch. But outside the car, we hear a characteristic change in pitch. To us, the sound of the ho rn slides from high 440 frequencies to low. A racing car traveling at 200 kilometers per hour 120 miles per hour is going almost one  fifth the speed of sound. Sound is a succession of waves in air, a crest and a trough, a crest and a trough. The closer together the waves are, the higher the frequency or pitch the farther apart the waves are, the lower the pitch.",
    "chunk_795": "If the car is racing away from us, it The Edge of Forever  253 stretches out the sound waves, moving them, from our point of view, to a lower pitch and producing the characteristic sound with which we are all familiar. If the car were racing toward us, the sound waves would be squashed together, the frequency would be increased, and we would hear a high pitched wail. If we knew what the ordinary pitch of the horn was when the car was at rest, we could deduce its speed blindfolded, from the change in pitch. Light is also a wave. Unlike sound, it travels perfectly well through a vacuum. The Doppler effect works here as well.",
    "chunk_796": "If instead of sound the automobile were for some reason emitting, front and back, a beam of pure yellow light, the frequency of the light would increase slightly as the car approached and decrease slightly as the car receded. At ordinary speeds the effect would be im perceptible. If, however, the car were somehow traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light, we would be able to observe the color of the light changing toward higher frequency, that is, toward blue, as the car approached us and toward lower frequencies, that is, toward red, as the car receded from us. An object approaching us at very high velocities is perceived to have the color of its spectral lines blue shifted. An object recedin g from us at very high velocities has its spectral lines redshifted.",

Large pieces of the telescope had to b e hauled to the top of the mountain, a job for mule teams. A young mule skinner named Milton Humason helped to transport mechanical and optical equipment, scientists, engineers and dignitaries up the mountain.

Slipher at Lowell Observatory, they began measuring the spectra of distant galaxies. It so on became clear that Humason was better able to obtain high quality spectra of distant galaxies than any professional astronomer in the world. He became a full staff member of the Mount Wilson Observatory, learned many of the scientific underpinnings of hi s work and died rich in the respect of the astronomical community.",
    "chunk_803": "The light from a galaxy is the sum of the light emitted by the billions of stars within it. As the light leaves these stars, certain frequencies or colors are absorbed by the atoms in the stars outermost layers. The resulting lines permit us to tell that stars millions of light years away contain the same chemical elements as our Sun and the nearby stars. Humason and Hubble found, to their amazement, that the spectra of all the distant galaxies are red shifted and, still more startling, that the more dista nt the galaxy was, the more red shifted were its spectral lines. The most obvious explanation of the red shift was in terms of the Doppler effect the galaxies were receding from us the more distant the galaxy the greater its speed of recession. But why should the galaxies be fleeing us?",
    "chunk_804": "Could there be something specia l about our location in the universe, as if the Milky Way had performed some inadvertent but offensive act in the social life of galaxies? It seemed much more likely that the universe itself was expanding, carrying the galaxies with it. Humason and Hubble, it gradually became clear, had discovered the Big Bang if not the origin of the universe then at least its most recent incarnation. Almost all of modern cosmology and especially the idea of an expanding universe and a Big Bang is based on the idea that the red 444 shift of distant galaxies is a Doppler effect and arises from their speed of recession. But there are other kinds of red shifts in nature.",
    "chunk_805": "There is, for example, the gravitational red shift, in which the light leaving an intense gravitational field has to do so much work to escape that it loses energy during the journey, the The Edge of Forever  255 process perceived by a distant observer as a shift of the escaping light to longer wavelengths and redder colors. Since we think there may be massive black holes at the centers of some galaxies, this is a conceivable explanation of their red shifts. Howeve r, the particular spectral lines observed are often characteristic of very thin, diffuse gas, and not the astonishingly high density that must prevail near black holes. Or the red shift might be a Doppler effect due not to the general expansion of the univ erse but rather to a more modest and local galactic explosion.",
    "chunk_806": "But then we should expect as many explosion fragments traveling toward us as away from us, as many blue shifts as red shifts. What we actually see, however, is almost exclusively red shifts no matter what distant objects beyond the Local Group we point our telescopes to. There is nevertheless a nagging suspicion among some astronomers that all may not be right with the deduction, from the red shifts of galaxies via the Doppler effect, that the universe is expanding. The astronomer Halton Arp has found enigmatic and disturb ing cases where a galaxy and a quasar, or a pair of galaxies, that are in apparent physical association have very different red shifts. Occasionally there seems to be a bridge of gas and dust and stars connecting them. If the red shift is due to the expans ion of the universe, very different red shifts imply very different distances.",

Such statistical alignments must happen by chance every now and then. The debate centers on whether the number of coincidences is more than would be expected by chance. Arp points to other cases in which a galaxy with a small red shift is flanked by two quasars of large and almost identical red shift.",
    "chunk_809": "He belie ves the quasars are not at cosmological distances but instead are being ejected, left and right, by the foreground galaxy and that the red shifts are the result of some as yetunfathomed mechanism. Skeptics argue coincidental alignment and the conventio nal Hubble Humason interpretation of the red shift. If Arp is right, the exotic mechanisms proposed to explain the energy source of distant quasars supernova chain reactions, supermassive black holes and the like would prove unnecessary. Quasars need not t hen be very distant. But some other exotic mechanism will be required to explain the red shift. In either case, something very strange is going on in the depths of space. The apparent recession of the galaxies, with the red shift interpreted through the Doppler effect, is not the only evidence for the Big Bang.",
    "chunk_810": "Independent and quite persuasive evidence derives from the cosmic black body background radiation, the faint stati c of radio waves coming quite uniformly from all directions in the Cosmos at just the intensity expected in our epoch from the now substantially cooled radiation of the Big Bang. But here also there is something puzzling. Observations with a sensitive radi o antenna carried near the top of the Earths atmosphere in a U 2 aircraft have shown that the background radiation is, to first approximation, just as intense in all directions as if the fireball of the Big Bang expanded quite uniformly, an origin of the universe with a very precise symmetry. But the background radiation, when examined to finer precision, proves to be imperfectly symmetrical.",
    "chunk_811": "There is a small systematic effect that could be understood if the entire Milky Way Galaxy and presumably other members of the Local Group were streaking toward the Virgo cluster of galaxies at more than a million miles an hour 600 kilometers per second. At such a rate, we will reach it in ten billion years, and extragalactic astronomy will then be a great deal eas ier. The Virgo cluster is already the richest collection of galaxies known, replete with spirals and ellipticals and irregulars, a jewel box in the sky. But why should we be rushing toward it?",
    "chunk_812": "George Smoot and his colleagues, who made these high altitude o bservations, suggest that the Milky Way is being gravitationally dragged toward the center of the Virgo cluster that the cluster has many more galaxies than have been detected heretofore and, most startling, that the cluster is of immense proportions, st retching across one or two billion light years of space. 447 The observable universe itself is only a few tens of billions of The Edge of Forever  257 lightyears across and, if there is a vast supercluster in the Virgo group, perhaps there are other such superclusters at much greater distances, which are correspondingly more difficult to detect. In the lifetime of the universe there has apparently not been enough time for an initial gravitational nonuniformity to collect the amount of mass that seems to reside in the Virgo supercluster.",
    "chunk_813": "Thus Smoot is tempted to conclude that the Big Bang was much less uniform than his other observations suggest, that the original distribution of matter in the universe was very lumpy. Som e little lumpiness is to be expected, and indeed even needed to understand the condensation of galaxies but a lumpiness on this scale is a surprise. Perhaps the paradox can be resolved by imagining two or more nearly simultaneous Big Bangs. If the general picture of an expanding universe and a Big Bang is correct, we must then confront still more difficult questions. What were conditions like at the time of the Big Bang? What happened before that? Was there a tiny universe, devoid of all matt er, and then the matter suddenly created from nothing? How does that happen? In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing.",
    "chunk_814": "But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must, of course ask next where God comes from. And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and decide that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable question? Or, if we say that God has always existed, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed? Every culture has a myth of the world before creation, and of the creation of the world, often by the mating of the gods or the hatching of a cosmic egg.

Sometimes such radio telescopes are connected with telescopes on the other side of the Earth, forming a baseline comparable to the Earths diameter in a certain sense, a telescope as large as the planet.",

Such telescopes may reveal the internal structure and nature of quasars. Perhaps a quasar standard candle will be found, and the distances to the quasars determined independent of their red shifts. By understanding the structure and the red shift of the most distant quasars it may be possible to see whether the expansion of the universe was faster billions of years ago, whether the expansion is slowing down, whether the universe will one day collapse.

Observatories in Earth orbit have found an intense X ray glow between the galaxies. It was first thought to be ho t intergalactic hydrogen, an immense amount of it never before seen, perhaps enough to close the Cosmos and to guarantee that we are trapped in an oscillating universe. But more recent observations by Ricardo Giacconi may have resolved the X ray glow into individual points, perhaps an immense horde of distant quasars. They contribute previously unknown mass to the universe as well.",
    "chunk_835": "When the cosmic inventory is completed, and the mass of all the galaxies, quasars, black holes, intergalactic hydrogen, gravita tional waves and still more exotic denizens of space is summed up, we will know what kind of universe we inhabit. In discussing the large scale structure of the Cosmos, astronomers are fond of saying that space is curved, or that there is no center to the Cosmos, or that the universe is finite but unbounded. Whatever are they talking about? Let us imagine we inhabit a strange country where everyone is perfectly flat. Following Edwin Abbott, a Shakespearean scholar who lived in Victorian England, we call it Flatland. Some of us are squares some are triangles some have more complex shapes. We scurry about, in and out o f our flat buildings, occupied with our flat businesses and dalliances. Everyone in Flatland has width and length, but no height whatever.",
    "chunk_836": "We know about left right and forward  back, but have no hint, not a trace of comprehension, about up down except for flat mathematicians. They say, Listen, its really very easy. Imagine left  right. Imagine forward  back. Okay, so far? Now imagine another dimension, at right angles to the other two. And we say, What are you talking about? At right angles to the other two! There are only two dimensions. Point to that third dimension. Where is it? So the mathematicians, disheartened, amble off. Nobody listens to mathematicians. Every square creature in Flatland sees another square as merely a short line segment, the side of the square nearest to him. He can see the other side of the square only by taking a short walk. But the inside of a square is forever mysterious, unless some terrible accident or autopsy breaches the sides and exposes the interior parts.",
    "chunk_837": "One day a three dimensional creature shaped like an apple, say  comes upon Flatland, hovering above it. Observing a particularly attractive and congenial looking square entering its flat house, the apple decides, in a gesture of interdimensional amity, to s ay hello. How are you? asks the visitor from the third The Edge of Forever  263 dimension. I am a visitor from the third dimension. The wretched square looks about his closed house and sees no one. What is worse, to him it appears that the greeting, entering from above, is emanating from his own flat body, a voice from within. A lit tle insanity, he perhaps reminds himself gamely, runs in the family. Exasperated at being judged a psychological aberration, the apple descends into Flatland.",
    "chunk_838": "Now a three  dimensional creature can exist, in Flatland, only partially only a cross section can be seen, only the points of contact with the plane surface of Flatla nd. An apple slithering through Flatland would appear first as a point and then as progressively larger, roughly circular slices. The square sees a point appearing in a closed room in his two dimensional world and slowly growing into a near circle. A crea ture of strange and changing shape has appeared from nowhere. Rebuffed, unhappy at the obtuseness of the very flat, the apple bumps the square and sends him aloft, fluttering and spinning into that mysterious third dimension. At first the square can make no sense of what is happening it is utterly outside his experi ence. But eventually he realizes that he is viewing Flatland from a peculiar vantage point above. He can see into closed rooms.",
    "chunk_839": "He can see into his flat fellows. He is viewing his universe from a unique and devastating perspective. Traveling through ano ther dimension provides, as an incidental benefit, a kind of X ray vision. Eventually, like a falling leaf, our square slowly descends to the surface. From the point of view of his fellow Flatlanders, he has unaccountably disappeared from a closed room and then distressingly materialized from nowhere. For heavens sake, they say, whats happened to you? I think, he finds himself replying, I was up. They pat him on his sides and comfort him. Delusions always ran in his family. In such interdimensional contemplations, we need not be restricted to two dimensions. We can, following Abbott, imagine a world of one dimension, where everyone is a line segment, or even the magical world of zero dimensional beasts, the points.",
    "chunk_840": "But perhaps more interesting is the question of higher dimensions. Could there be a fourth physical dimension? We can imagine generating a cube in the following way Take a line segment of a certain length and move it an equal length at right angles to itself. That makes a square.

If we examine the shadow of a cube in two dimensions, we notice that not all the lines appear equal, and not all the angles are right angles.

    "chunk_842": "Now let us take our three dimensional cube and carry it, at right angles to itself, t hrough a fourth physical dimension not left  right, not forward  back, not up down, but simultaneously at right angles to all those directions. I cannot show you what direction that is, but I can imagine it to exist. In such a case, we would have generated a four dimensional hypercube, also called a tesseract. I cannot show you a tesseract, because we are trapped in three dimensions. But what I can show you is the shadow in three dimensions of a tesseract. It resembles two nested cubes, all the vertices con nected by lines. But for a real tesseract, in four dimensions, all the lines would be of equal length and all the angles would be right angles.",
    "chunk_843": "Imagine a universe just like Flatland, except that unbeknownst to the inhabitants, their two dimensional universe is curved through a third physical dimension. When the Flatlanders take short excursions, their universe looks flat enough. But if one of them takes a long enough walk along what seems to be a perfectly straight line, he uncovers a great mystery although he has not reached a barrier and has never turned around, he has somehow come back to the place from which he started. His two  dimensional universe must have been warped, bent or curved through a mysterious third dimension. He cannot imagine that third dimension, but he can deduce it. Increase all dimensions in this story by one, and you have a situation that may apply to us. Where is the center of the Cosmos? Is there an edge to the universe? What lies beyond that?",
    "chunk_844": "In a two dimensional universe, curved through a third dimension, there is no center at least not on the surface of the sphere. The center of such a universe is not in that universe it lies, inaccessible, in the third dimension, inside the sphere. While there is only so much area on the surface of the sphere, there is no edge to this universe it is finite but unbounded. And the question of what lies beyond is meaningless. Flat creatures cannot, on their own, escape their two dimensions. Increase all dimensions by one, and you have the situation that may apply to us the universe as a four dimensional hypersphere with no center and no edge, and nothing beyond. Why do all the galaxies seem to be running away from us?",

Sometime after the expansion begins, galaxies condense and are carried outward on the surface of the hypersphere. There are The Edge of Forever  265  Cosmos astronomers in each galaxy, and the light they see is also trapped on the curved surface of the hypersphere. As the sphere expands, an astronomer in any galaxy will think all the other galaxies are running away from him. There are no privileged reference f rames. The farther away the galaxy, the faster its recession. The galaxies are embedded in, attached to space, and the fabric of space is expanding. And to the question, Where in the present universe did the Big Bang occur? the answer is clearly, everywhe re.",
    "chunk_846": "If there is insufficient matter to prevent the universe from expanding forever, it must have an open shape, curved like a saddle with a surface extending to infinity in our three dimensional analogy. If there is enough matter, then it has a closed shape, curved like a sphere in our three dimensional analogy. If the universe is closed, light is trapped within it. In the 1920s, in a direction opposite to M31, observers found a distant pair of spiral galaxies. Was it possible, they wondered, that they were seeing the Milky Way and M31 from the other direction like seeing the back of your head with light that has circumnavigated the universe? We now know that the universe is much larger than they imagined in the 1920s. It would take more than the age o f the universe for light to circumnavigate it.",
    "chunk_847": "And the galaxies are younger than the universe. But if the Cosmos is closed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to describe the universe as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look around you. We have previously mentioned the possibility of wormholes to get from one place in the universe to another without covering the intervening distance through a black hole. We can imagine these wormholes as tubes running through a fourth physical dimension. We do not know that such wormholes exist. But if they do, must they always hook up with another place in our universe? Or is it just possible that wormholes connect with other universes, places that would otherwise be forever inaccessible to us? For all we know, there may be many other universes.",

It is entirely undemonstrated it may never be proved. But it stirs the blood. There is, we are told, an infinite hierarchy of universes, so that an elementary particle, such as an electron, in our universe would, if penetrated, reveal itself to be an entire closed universe.

Would they be built on different laws of physics? Would they have stars and galaxies and worlds, or something quite different? Might they be compatible with some unimaginably different form of life?

Those ancestors of the whales who relied on these senses to locate a mate or a baby or a predator did not leave many offspring. So a nother method was perfected by evolution it works superbly well and is central to any understanding of the whales the sense of sound.

Oc casionally a group of whales will leave their winter waters in the midst of a song and six months later return to continue at precisely the right note, as if there had been no interruption. Whales are very good at remembering. More often, on their return, the vocalizations have changed. New songs appear on the cetacean hit parade. Very often the members of the group will sing the same song together. By some mutual consensus, some collaborative song writing, the piece changes month by month, slowly and predictably. These vocalizations are complex.",

For 99.99 percent of the history of the whales, there were no humans in or on the deep oceans. During this period the whales evolved their extraordinary audio communication system. The finbacks, for example, emit extremely loud sounds at a frequency of twenty Hertz, down near the lowest octave on the piano keyboard. A Hertz is a unit of sound frequency that represents one sound wave, one crest and one trough, entering your ear every second. Such low  frequency sounds are scarcely absorbed in the ocean.",

One might be off the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica and communicate wit h another in the Aleutians. For most of their history, the whales may have established a global communications network. Perhaps when separated by 15,000 kilometers, their vocalizations are love songs, cast hopefully into the vastness of the deep. For tens of millions of years these enormous, intelligent, communicative creatures evolved with essentially no natural enemies. Then the development of the steamship in the nineteenth century introduced an ominous source of noise pollution. As commercial a nd military vessels became more abundant, the noise background in the oceans, especially at a frequency of twenty Hertz, became noticeable. Whales communicating across the oceans must have experienced increasingly greater difficulties.",
    "chunk_862": "The distance over wh ich they could communicate must have decreased steadily. Two hundred years ago, a typical distance across which finbacks could communicate was perhaps 10,000 kilometers. Today, the corresponding number is perhaps a few hundred kilometers. Do whales know ea ch others names? Can they recognize each other as individuals by sounds alone? We have cut the whales off from themselves. Creatures that communicated for tens of millions of years have now effectively been silenced. There is a curious counterpoint to this story.

Each of us has perhaps a hundred bill ion neurons, comparable to the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Many neurons have thousands of connections with their neighbors. There are something like a hundred trillion, 1014, such connections in the human cerebral cortex.",

The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the cortex becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one a shifting harmony of sub patterns. Now as the waking body rouses, sub  patterns of this great harmo ny of activity stretch down into the unlit tracks of the lower brain. Strings of flashing and traveling sparks engage the links of it. This means that the body is up and rises to meet its waking day.",

There are many valleys in the mountains of the mind, convolutions that greatly increase the surface area available in the cerebral cortex for information storage in a skull of limited size. The neurochemistry of the brain is astonishingly busy, the circuit ry of a machine more wonderful than any devised by humans. But there is no evidence that its functioning is due to anything more than the 1014 neural connections that build an elegant architecture of consciousness. The world of thought is divided roughly i nto two hemispheres. The right hemisphere of the cerebral cortex is mainly responsible for pattern recognition, intuition, sensitivity, creative insights.",
    "chunk_879": "The left hemisphere presides over rational, analytical and critical thinking. These are the dual stre ngths, the essential opposites, that characterize human thinking. Together, they provide the means both for generating ideas and for testing their validity. A continuous dialogue is going on between the two hemispheres, channeled through an immense bundle of nerves, the corpus callosum, the bridge between creativity and analysis, both of which are necessary to understand the world. The information content of the human brain expressed in bits is probably comparable to the total number of connections among the neurons about a hundred trillion, 1014, bits. If written out in English, say, that information would fill some twenty million volumes, as many as in the worlds largest libraries. The equivalent of twenty million books is inside the heads of every one of us. The brain is a very big place in a very small space.",
    "chunk_880": "Most of the books in the brain are in the cerebral cortex. Down in the basement are the functions our remote ancestors mainly depended on aggression, child rearing, fear, sex, the willingness to follow leaders blindly. Of the higher brain functions, some  reading, writing, speaking seem to be localized in particular places in the cerebral cortex. Memories, on the other hand, are stored redundantly in many locales. If such a thing as telepathy existed, one of its glories would be the opportunity for each of us to read the books in the cerebral cortices of our loved ones. But th ere is no compelling evidence for telepathy, and the communication of such information remains the task of artists and writers. The brain does much more than recollect. It compares, synthesizes, analyzes, generates abstractions. We must figure out much more than our genes can know.",
    "chunk_881": "That is why the brain library is some ten thousand times larger than the gene library. Our passion fo r learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival. Emotions and ritualized behavior patterns are built deeply into us. They are part of our humanity. But they are not characteristically human. Many other animals have feelin gs. What distinguishes our species is thought. The cerebral cortex is a liberation. We need no longer be trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of lizards and baboons. We are, each of us, largely responsible for what The Persistence of Memory  279 gets put into our brains, for what, as adults, we wind up caring for and knowing about.

The evolution of a city is like the evolution of the brain it develops from a small cen ter and slowly grows and changes, leaving many old parts still functioning. There is no way for evolution to rip out the ancient interior of the brain because of its imperfections and replace it with something of more modern manufacture. The brain must fun ction during the renovation. That is why the brainstem is surrounded by the R  complex, then the limbic system and finally the cerebral cortex. The old parts are in charge of too many fundamental functions for them to be replaced altogether. So they wheeze along, out ofdate and sometimes counterproductive, but a necessary consequence of our evolution.",
    "chunk_883": "In New York City, the arrangement of many of the major streets dates to the seventeenth century, the stock exchange to the eighteenth century, the waterworks to the nineteenth, the electrical power system to the twentieth. The arrangement might be more eff icient if all civic systems were constructed in parallel and replaced periodically which is why disastrous fires the great conflagrations of London and Chicago, for example are sometimes an aid in city planning. But the slow accretion of new functions pe rmits the city to work more or less continuously through the centuries. In the seventeenth century you traveled between Brooklyn and Manhattan across the East River by ferry. In the nineteenth century, the technology became available to construct a suspens ion bridge across the river.",
    "chunk_884": "It was built precisely at the site of the ferry terminal, both because the city owned the land and because major thoroughfares were already converging on the pre  existing ferry service. Later when it was possible to construct a tunnel under the river, it too was built in the same place for the same reasons, and also because small abandoned precursors of tunnels, called caissons, had already been emplaced during the construction of the bridge. This use and restructuring of previo us systems for new purposes is very much like the pattern of biological evolution. When our genes could not store all the information necessary for survival, we slowly invented brains. But then the time came, perhaps ten thousand years ago, when we needed to know more than could conveniently be contained in brains. So we learned to stock pile enormous quantities of information outside our bodies.",

Its purpose was to keep records the purchase of grain, the sale of land, the triumphs of the k ing, the statutes of the priests, the positions of the stars, the prayers to the gods. For thousands of years, writing was chiseled into clay and stone, scratched onto wax or bark or leather painted on bamboo or papyrus or silk but always one copy at a ti me and, except for the inscriptions on monuments, always for a tiny readership. Then in China between the second and sixth centuries, paper, ink and printing with carved wooden blocks were all invented, permitting many copies of a work to be made and distr ibuted. It took a thousand years for the idea to catch on in remote and backward Europe.",
    "chunk_888": "Then, suddenly, books were being printed all over the world. Just before the invention of movable type, around 1450, there were no more than a few tens of thousands of books in all of Europe, all handwritten about as many as in China in 100 B.C., and a tenth as many as in the Great Library of Alexandria. Fifty years later, around 1500, there were ten million printed books. Learning had become available to anyone who could read. Magic was everywhere. More recently, books, especially paperbacks, have been printed in massive and inexpensive editions. For the price of a modest meal you can ponder the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, the origin of species, the interpretation of dreams, the nature of t hings. Books are like seeds. They can lie dormant for centuries and then flower in the most unpromising soil.",

Public libraries depend on v oluntary contributions. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.

Happenstance may play a powerful role in biology, as it does in history. The farther back the critical events occur, the more po werfully can they influence the present. For example, consider our hands. We have five fingers, including one opposable thumb. They serve us quite well. But I think we would be served equally well with six fingers including a thumb, or four fingers including a thumb, or maybe five fingers and two thumbs. There is nothing intrinsically best about our particular configuration of fingers, which we ordinarily think of as so natural and inevitable. We have five fingers because we have descended from a Devonian fish that had five phalanges or bones in i ts fins.",

We use base ten arithmetic only because we have ten fingers on our hands. Had the arrangement been oth erwise, we would use base eight or base twelve arithmetic and relegate base ten to the New Math. The same point applies, I believe, to many more essential aspects of our being our hereditary material, our internal biochemistry, our form, stature, organ sys tems, loves and hates, passions and despairs, tenderness and aggression, even our analytical processes all of these are, at least in part, the result of apparently minor accidents in our immensely long evolutionary history.

It would have taken a very audacious biologist to guess that such animals would eventually produce th e line that dominates the Earth today.

But the dinosaurs did not survive. In one catastrophic event all of them and many, perhaps most, of the other species on the Earth, were destroyed. But not the tree shrews. Not the mammals.

It was a slab from an ancient temple, displaying what seemed clearly to be the same message in three different writings in hierogl yphics at top, in a kind of cursive hieroglyphic called demotic in the middle, and, the key to the enterprise, in Greek at the bottom.

This, Champollion reasoned, very probably also denotes Ptolemy. If so, the writing could not be funda mentally pictographic or metaphorical rather, most of the symbols must stand for letters or syllables. Champollion also had the presence of mind to count up the number of Greek words and the number of individual hieroglyphs in what were presumably equival ent texts.

We know N , the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, fairly well, by careful counts of stars in small but representative regions of the sky. It is a few hundred billion some recent estimates place it at 4  1011. Very few of these stars are of the massive short  lived variety that squander their reserves of thermonuclear fuel. The great majority have lifetimes of billions or more years in which they are shining stably, providing a suitable energy source for the or igin and evolution of life on nearby planets.",

Multiplying these factors together, we find N fpneflfifc  1  109, a billion planets on which technical civilizations have arisen at least once.

This alone, quite apart from the contents of the message, provides a powerful justification for the search for other civilizations.

Even at the speed of light it would take two centuries for a radio message to get from there to here. If we had initiated the dialogue, it would be as if the question had been asked by Johannes Kepler and the answer received by us.

To look upon the Raven was to be turned to stone. In their fright, the Tlingit fled into the forest and hid. But after a while, finding that no harm had come to them, a few more enterprising souls crept out and rolled leaves of the skunk cabbage into crude telescopes, believing that this would prevent being turned to stone.

With his impaired vision he could barely make out the many black forms moving before him. Perhaps they were crows.

Nevertheless, the Aztecs had no illusions about the Spaniards, whom they described in these words They seized upon the gold as if they were monkeys, their faces gleaming. For clearly their thirst for gold was insatiable they starved for it they lusted for it they wanted to stuff themselves with it as if they were pigs.",

But their insight into the Spanish character did not help them defend themselves. In 1517 a great comet had been seen in Mexico. Moctezuma, captured by the legend of the return of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl as a white skinned man arriving across the Eastern sea, promptly executed his astrologers. They had not predicted the comet, and they had not explained it. Certain of forthcoming disaster, Moctezuma became distant and gloomy. Aided b y the superstition of the Aztecs and their own superior technology, an armed party of 400 Europeans and their native allies in the year 1521 entirely vanquished and utterly destroyed a high civilization of a million people.",

Yet the technological gap between them and the Spaniards was not very great, perhaps a few centuries. We must be the most backward technical society in the Galaxy. Any society still more backward would not have radio astronomy at all. If the doleful experience of cultural conflict on Earth were the galactic standard, it seems we would already have been des troyed, perhaps with some passing admiration expressed for Shakespeare, Bach and Vermeer. But this has not happened. Perhaps alien intentions are uncompromisingly benign, more like La P\u00e9rouse than Cortes. Or might it be, despite all the pretensions about U FOs and ancient astronauts, that our civilization has not yet been discovered?",
    "chunk_971": "On the one hand, we have argued that if even a small fraction of technical civilizations learn to live with themselves and with weapons of mass destruction, there should now be an enormous number of advanced civilizations in the Galaxy. We already have slow interstellar flight, and think fast interstellar flight a possible goal for the human species. On the other hand, we maintain that there is no credible evidence for the Earth being visite d, now or ever. Is this not a contradiction? If the nearest civilization is, say, 200 light years away, it takes only 200 years to get from there to here at close to the speed of light. Even at 1 percent or a tenth of a percent of the speed of light, being s from nearby civilizations could have come during the tenure of humanity on Earth. Why are they not here?",
    "chunk_972": "There are many possi ble answers. Although it runs contrary to the heritage of Aristarchus and Copernicus, perhaps we are the first. Some technical civilization must be the first to emerge in the history of the Galaxy. Perhaps we are mistaken in our belief that at least occasi onal civilizations avoid Encyclopaedia Galactica 524 selfdestruction. Perhaps there is some unforeseen problem to interstellar spaceflight although, at speeds much less than the velocity of light it is difficult to see what such an impediment might be. Or perhaps they are here, 308  Cosmos but in hiding because of some Lex Galactica , some ethic of A schematic representation of an advanced technical civilization which rebuilds its solar system into a spherical shell of matter surrounding the local Sun, so the valuable starlight is not mainly lost to space.

    "chunk_973": "We can imagine them, curious and dispassionate, observing us, as we would watch a bacterial culture in a dish of agar, to determine whether, this year again, we manage to avoid self  destruction. But there is another explanation that is consistent with everything we know. If a great many years ago an advanced interstellar spacefaring civilization emerged 200 light years away, it would have no reason to think there was something special about the Ea rth unless it had been here already. No artifact of human technology, not even our radio transmissions, has had time, even traveling at the speed of light, to go 200 lightyears. From their point of view, all nearby star systems are more or less equally at tractive for exploration or colonization. An emerging technical civilization, after exploring its home planetary system and developing interstellar spaceflight, would slowly and tentatively begin exploring the nearby stars.",
    "chunk_974": "Some stars would have no suitable planets perhaps they would all be giant gas worlds, or tiny asteroids. Others would carry an entourage of suitable planets, but some would be already inhabited, or the atmosphere would be poisonous or the climate uncomfortable. In many cases the colonists might have to change or as we would paro chially say, terraform a world to make it adequately clement. The re engineering of a planet will take time. Occasionally, an already suitable world would be found and colonized. The utilization of planetary resources so that new interstellar spacecraft co uld be constructed locally would be a slow process. Eventually a second generation mission of exploration and colonization would take off toward stars where no one had yet been. And in this way a civilization might slowly wend its way like a vine among the worlds.",
    "chunk_975": "It is possible that at some later time with third and higher orders of colonies developing new worlds, another independent expanding civilization would be discovered. Very likely mutual contact would already have been made by radio or other remote means. T he new arrivals might be a different sort of colonial society.

No civilization can possibly survive to an interstellar spacefaring phase unless it limits its numbers. Any society with a marked population explosion will be forced to devote all its energies and technological skills to feeding and caring for the populati on on its home planet. This is a very powerful conclusion and is in no way based on the idiosyncrasies of a particular civilization.",
    "chunk_978": "On any planet, no matter what its biology or social system, an exponential increase in population will swallow every resour ce. Conversely, any civilization that engages in serious interstellar exploration and colonization must have exercised zero population growth or something very close to it for many generations. But a civilization with a low population growth rate will take a long time to colonize many worlds, even if the strictures on rapid population growth are eased after reaching some lush Eden. My colleague William Newman and I have calculated that if a million years ago a spacefaring civilization with a low population growth rate emerged two hundred light years away and spread outward, colonizing suitable worlds along the way, their survey starships would be entering our solar system only about now. But a million years is a very long period of time.",
    "chunk_979": "If the nearest civilization is younger than this, they would not have reached us yet. A sphere two hundred light years in radius contains 200,000 sun s and perhaps a comparable number of worlds suitable for colonization. It is only after 200,000 other worlds have been colonized that, in the usual course of things, our solar system would be accidentally discovered to harbor an indigenous civilization. What does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old? We have had radio telescopes and spaceships for a few decades our technical civilization is a few hundred years old, scientific ideas of a modern cast a few thousand, civilization in general a few tens of thousands of years human beings evolved on this p lanet only a few million years ago.",
    "chunk_980": "At anything like our present rate of technical progress, an advanced civilization millions of years old is as much beyond us as we are beyond a bush baby or a macaque. Would we even recognize its presence? Would a societ y a million years in advance of us be interested in colonization or interstellar spaceflight? People have a finite lifespan for a reason. Enormous progress in the biological and medical sciences might uncover that reason and lead to suitable remedies. Coul d it be that we are so interested in spaceflight because it is a way of perpetuating ourselves beyond our own lifetimes? Might a civilization composed of essentially immortal beings consider interstellar exploration fundamentally childish?",
    "chunk_981": "It may be that we hav e not been visited because the stars are strewn abundantly in the expanse of space, so that before a nearby civilization arrives, Encyclopaedia Galactica it has altered its exploratory motivations or evolved into forms indetectable to us. A standard motif in science fiction and UFO literature assumes extraterrestrials roughly as capable as we. Perhaps they have a different sort of spaceship or ray gun, but in battle and science fiction loves to portray battles between civilizations they and we are rather evenly matched. In fact, there is almost no chance that two galactic civilizations will interact at the same level. In any confrontation, one will always utterly dominate the other. A million years is a great many. If an advanced civilizatio n were to arrive in our solar system, there would be nothing whatever we could do about it.",
    "chunk_982": "Their science and technology would be far beyond ours. It is pointless to worry about the possible malevolent intentions of an advanced civilization with whom we mi ght make contact. It is more likely that the mere fact they have survived so long means they have learned to live with themselves and others. Perhaps our fears about extraterrestrial contact are merely a projection of our own backwardness, an expression of our guilty conscience about our past history the ravages that have been visited on civilizations only slightly more backward than we. We remember Columbus and the Arawaks, Cort\u00e9s and the Aztecs, even the fate of the Tlingit in the generations after La P\u00e9 rouse. We remember and we worry. But if an interstellar armada appears in our skies, I predict we will be very accommodating.",
    "chunk_983": "A very different kind of contact is much more likely the case we have already discussed in which we receive a rich, complex message, probably by radio, from another civilization in space, but do not make, at least for a while, physical contact with them.

L. F. Richardson was a British meteorologist interested in war. He wished to understand its causes. There are intellectual parallels between war and weather. Both are complex. Both exhibit regularities, implying that they are not implacable forces but natu ral systems that can be understood and controlled. To understand the global weather you must first collect a great body of meteorological data you must discover how the weather actually behaves.",
    "chunk_1014": "Our approach must be the same, Richardson decided, if we are to understand warfare. So, for the years between 1820 and 1945, he collected data on the hundreds of wars that had then been fought on our poor planet. Richardsons results were published posthumously in a book called The Statistics of Deadly Quarrels . Because he was interested in how long you had to wait for a war that would claim a specified number of victims, he defined an index, M, the magnitude of a war, a measure of the number of immediate deaths it causes. A war of magnitude M  3 might be merel y a skirmish, killing only a thousand people l03. M  5 or M  6 denote more serious wars, where a hundred thousand l05 or a million 106 people are killed.

Individual killings and wars on the largest scale are, he said, two ends of a continuum, an unbroken curve. It follows, not only in a trivial sense but also I bel ieve in a very deep psychological sense, that war is murder writ large. When our well  being is threatened, when our illusions about ourselves are challenged, we tend some of us at least to fly into murderous rages. And when the same provocations are applie d to nation states, they, too, sometimes fly into murderous rages, egged on often enough by those seeking personal power or profit.",
    "chunk_1017": "But as the technology of murder improves and the penalties of war increase, a great many people must be made to fly into mur derous rages simultaneously for a major war to be mustered. Because the organs of mass communication are often in the hands of the state, this can commonly be arranged. Nuclear war is the exception. It can be triggered by a very small number of people. We see here a conflict between our passions and what is sometimes called our better natures between the deep, ancient reptilian part of the brain, the R complex, in charge of murderous rages, and the more recently evolved mammalian and human parts of the brain, the limbic system and the cerebral cortex. When humans lived in small groups, when our weapons were comparatively paltry, even an enraged warrior could kill only a few.",
    "chunk_1018": "As our technology improved, the means of war also improved. In the same brief in terval, we also have improved. We have tempered our anger, frustration and despair with reason. We have ameliorated on a planetary scale injustices that only recently were global and endemic. But our weapons can now kill billions. Have we improved fast enough? Are w e teaching reason as effectively as we can? Have we courageously studied the causes of war? What is often called the strategy of nuclear deterrence is remarkable for its reliance on the behavior of our nonhuman ancestors. Henry Kissinger, a contemporary politician, wrote Deterrence depends, above all, on psychological criteria. For purposes of deterrence, a bluff taken seriously is more useful than a serious threat interpreted as a bluff. Truly effective nuclear bluffing, however, includes occasional postures of irrationality, a distancing from the horrors of nuclear war.",

But the proliferation of nuclear weapons has probably moved the curve into the shaded area, and the waiting time to Doomsday may be ominously short. The shape of the Richardson curve is within our control, but only if humans are willing to embrace nuclear disarma ment and restructure dramatically the planetary community. The potential enemy is assured that if the limit is transgressed, nuclear war will follow. However, the definition of the limit changes from time to time. Each side must be quite confident that the other understands the new limits. Each side is tempted to increase its military advantage, but not in so striking a way as seriously to alarm the other.",

The global balance of terror is a very delicate balance. It depends on things not going wrong, on mistakes not being made, on the reptilian passions not being seriously aroused. And so we return to Richardson. In the diagram the solid line is the waiting time for a war of magnitude M that is, the average time we would have to wait to witness a war that kills 10M people where M represents the number of zeroes after the one in our usual exponential arithmetic.",

Thus, the top of the Richardson curve is shifting downward by an unknown amount. If its new position is somewhere in the shaded region of the figure, we may have only another few decades until Doomsday. A more detailed comparison of the incidence of wars before and after 1945 might help to clarify this question. It is of more than passing concern. This is merely another way of saying what we have known for decades the development of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems will, sooner or later, lead to global disaster.

But their pleas went unheeded the prospect of a national strategic advantage galvanized both the U.S.S.R. and the United States, and the nuclear arms race began. In the same period, there was a burgeoning international trade in the devastating non nuclear weapons coyly called conventional. In the past twenty five years, in dollars corrected for inflation, the annual international arms trade has gone from 300 mil lion to much more than 20 billion. In the years between 1950 and 1968, for which good statistics seem to be available, there were, on the average, worldwide several accidents involving nuclear weapons per year, although perhaps no more than one or two acc idental nuclear explosions. The weapons establishments in the Soviet Union, the United States and other nations are large and powerful.",
    "chunk_1025": "In the United States they include major corporations famous for their homey domestic manufactures. According to one esti mate, the corporate profits in military weapons procurement are 30 to 50 percent higher than in an equally technological but competitive civilian market. Cost overruns in military weapons systems are permitted on a scale that would be considered unacceptab le in the civilian sphere. In the Soviet Union the resources, quality, attention and care given to military production is in striking contrast to the little left for consumer goods. According to some estimates, almost half the scientists and high technolog ists on Earth are employed full  or part time on military matters. Those engaged in the development and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction are given salaries, perquisites of power and, where possible, public honors at the highest levels available i n their respective societies.",

Full scale nuclear war has never happened. Somehow this is taken to imply that it never will. But we can experience it only once. By then it will be too late to refor mulate the statistics.

Would not a rational society spend more on understanding and preventing, than on preparing for, the next war? It is possible to study the caus es of war. At present our understanding is meager probably because disarmament budgets have, since the time of Sargon of Akkad, been somewhere between ineffective and nonexistent. Microbiologists and physicians study diseases mainly to cure people. Rarely are they rooting for the pathogen. Let us study war as if it were, as Einstein aptly called it, an illness of childhood.

If it is really true that the R complex and limbic systems live in an uneasy truce within our skulls and still partake of their ancient predelictions, we might expect affectionate parental indulgence to encourage our mammalian natures, and the absence of physical affection to prod reptilian behavior. There is some evidence that this is the case. In laboratory experiments, Harry and Margaret Harlow found that monkeys raised in cages and physically isolated even though they could see, hear and smell their simian fellows developed a range of morose, withdrawn, self destructive and otherwise abnormal characteristics. In humans the same is observed for children raised without physical affection usually in institutions where they are clearly in great pain.",
    "chunk_1035": "The neuropsychologist James W. Prescott has performed a startling cross cultural statistical analysis of 400 preindustrial societies and found that cultures that lavish physical affection on infants tend to be disinclined to violence. Even societies withou t notable fondling of infants develop nonviolent adults, provided sexual activity in adolescents is not repressed. Prescott believes that cultures with a predisposition for violence are composed of individuals who have been deprived during at least one of two critical stages in life, infancy and adolescence of the pleasures of the body. Where physical affection is encouraged, theft, organized religion and invidious displays of wealth are inconspicuous where infants are physically punished, there tends to be sl avery, frequent killing, torturing and mutilation of enemies, a devotion to the inferiority of women, and a belief in one or more supernatural beings who intervene in daily life.",
    "chunk_1036": "We do not understand human behavior well enough to be sure of the mechanisms underlying these relationships, although we can conjecture. But the correlations are significant. Prescott writes The percent likelihood of a society becoming physically violent if it is physically affectionate toward its infants and tolerant of premarital sexual behavior is 2 percent. The probability of this relationship occurring by chance is 125,000 to one. I am not aware of any other developmental variable that has such a high degree of predictive validity. Infants hunger for phy sical affection adolescents are strongly driven to sexual activity. If youngsters 332  Cosmos had their way, societies might develop in which adults have little tolerance for aggression, territoriality, ritual and social hierarchy although in the course of growing up the children might well experience these reptilian behaviors.",

If the inclinations toward slavery and racism, misogyny and violence are connected as individual character and human history, as well as cross cultural studies, suggest then there is room for some optimism. We are surrounded by recent fundamental changes i n society.

Therefore p2 is an even number. But the square of any odd number is odd l2  1, 32  9, 52  25, 72  49, etc.. So p itself must be even, and we can write p  2s, where s is some other integer. Substituting for p in Equation 1, we find p2  2s2  4s2  2q2 Dividing both sides of the last equality by 2, we find q2  2s2 Therefore q2 is also an even number, and, by the same argument as we just used for p, it follows that q is even too.",

We also know that r is 3 or more, since at least 3 faces meet at a given vertex in a polyhedron. If both n and r were simultaneously more than 3, the left hand side of Equation 5 would be less than \u00b2 3 and the equation could not be satisfied for any positive value of E.
