A single lifetime, \neven though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough \nfor the investigation of so vast a subject . . . And so this \nknowle dge will be unfolded only through long successive ages. \nThere will come a time when our descendants will be amazed \nthat we did not know things that are so plain to them . . . Many \ndiscoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of \nus will have  been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair \nunless it has in it something for every age to investigate . . . \nNature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all.  \n\u2014Seneca, Natural Questions, \nBook 7, first century  \nIn ancient times, in everyday speech and custom, the most \nmundane happenings were connected with the grandest cosmic \nevents. A charming example is an incantation against the worm which \nthe Assyrians of 1000 B.C. imagined to cause toothaches. It begins with \nthe origin of the universe and ends with a cure for toothache:  \nAfter Anu had created the heaven, And \nthe heaven had created the earth,  \nAnd the earth had created the rivers,  \nAnd the rivers had created the canals, \nAnd the canals had created the morass, \nAnd the morass had created the worm, \nThe worm went before Shamash, \nweeping, His tears flowing before Ea:  \n\u201cWhat wilt thou give me for my food,  \nWhat wilt thou give me for my drink?\u201d  \n\u201cI will give thee the dried fig And \nthe apricot.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat are these to me? The dried fig And \nthe apricot!  \nLift me up, and among the teeth  \nAnd the gums let me dwell!...\u201d  \nBecause thou hast said this, O worm,  \nMay Ea smite thee with the might of His \nhand!  \n(Incantation against toothache.)  \nIts treatment: Second -grade beer . . . and oil thou shalt mix together;   \nThe incantation thou shalt recite three times thereon and shalt \nput the medicine upon the tooth.   \nxii \u2014 Introduction  \nOur ancestors were eager to understand the world but had not \nquite stumbled upon the method. They imagined a small, quaint, tidy \nuniverse in which the dominant forces were gods like Anu, Ea, and \nShamash. In that universe humans played an important if not a  \ncentral role. We were intimately bound up with the rest of nature. \nThe treatment of toothache with second -rate beer was tied to the \ndeepest cosmological mysteries.  \nToday we have discovered a powerful and elegant way to \nunderstand the universe, a method called science; it has revealed to us \na universe so ancient and so vast that human affairs seem at first sight \nto be of little consequence. We have grown distant from the Cosmos. \nIt has seemed remote and irrelevant to everyday concerns. But science \nhas found not only that the universe has a reeling and ecstatic \ngrandeur, not only that it is accessible to human understanding, but \nalso that we are, in a very real and prof ound sense, a part of that \nCosmos, born from it, our fate deeply connected with it. The most \nbasic human events and the most trivial trace back to the universe and \nits origins. This book is devoted to the exploration of that cosmic \nperspective.  \nIn the summer and fall of 1976, as a member of the Viking Lander \nImaging Flight Team, I was engaged, with a hundred of my scientific \ncolleagues, in the exploration of the planet Mars. For the first time in \nhuman history we had landed two space vehicles on the surface of \nanother world. The results, described  \nmore fully in Chapter 5, were spectacular, the historical significance \nof the mission utterly apparent. And yet the general public was \nlearning almost nothing of these great happenings. The press was \nlargely inattentive; television ignored the mission almo st altogether. \nWhen it became clear that a definitive answer on whether there is life \non Mars would not be forthcoming, interest dwindled still further. \nThere was little tolerance for ambiguity. When we found the sky of \nMars to be a kind of pinkish -yellow rather than the blue which had \nerroneously first been reported, the announcement was greeted by a \nchorus of good -natured boos from the assembled reporters \u2014they \nwanted Mars to be, even in this respect, like the Earth. They believed \nthat their audiences woul d be progressively disinterested as Mars was \nrevealed to be less and less like the Earth. And yet the Martian \nlandscapes are staggering, the vistas breathtaking. I was positive from \nmy own  \nexperience that an enormous global interest exists in the exploration \nof the planets and in many kindred scientific topics \u2014the origin of life, \nthe Earth, and the Cosmos, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,  \nour connection with the universe. And I was certain that this interest \ncould be excited through that most powerful communications \nmedium, television.  \nMy feelings were shared by B. Gentry Lee, the Viking Data Analysis \nand Mission Planning Director, a man of extraordinary organizational \nabilities. We decided, gamely, to do something about the problem \nourselves. Lee proposed that we form a   \nIntroduction \u2014 xiii \nproduction company devoted to the communication of science in an \nengaging and accessible way. In the following months we were \napproached on a number of projects. But by far the most interesting \nwas an inquiry tendered by KCET, the Public Broadcasting Servi ce\u2019s \noutlet in Los Angeles. Eventually, we jointly agreed to produce a \nthirteen -part television series oriented toward astronomy but with a \nvery broad human perspective. It was to be aimed at popular \naudiences, to be visually and musically stunning, and to  engage the \nheart as well as the mind. We talked with underwriters, hired an \nexecutive producer, and found ourselves embarked on a three -year \nproject called Cosmos . At this writing it has an estimated worldwide \nviewing audience of 140 million people, or 3 percent of the human \npopulation of the planet Earth. It is dedicated to the proposition that \nthe public is far more intelligent than it has generally been given cr edit \nfor; that the deepest scientific questions on the nature and origin of \nthe world excite the interests and passions of enormous numbers of \npeople. The present epoch is a major crossroads for our civilization \nand perhaps for our species. Whatever road w e take, our fate is \nindissolubly bound up with science. It is essential as a matter of simple \nsurvival for us to understand science. In addition, science is a delight; \nevolution has arranged that we take pleasure in understanding \u2014those \nwho understand are m ore likely to survive. The Cosmos  television \nseries and this book represent a hopeful experiment in \ncommunicating some of the ideas, methods and joys of science.  \nThe book and the television series evolved together. In some sense \neach is based on the other. Many illustrations in this book are based \non the striking visuals prepared for the television series. But books and \ntelevision series have somewhat different aud iences and admit \ndiffering approaches. One of the great virtues of a book is that it is \npossible for the reader to return repeatedly to obscure or difficult \npassages; this is only beginning to become possible, with the \ndevelopment of videotape and video -disc technology, for television. \nThere is much more freedom for the author in choosing the range and \ndepth of topics for a chapter in a book than for the procrustean fifty -\neight minutes, thirty seconds of a noncommercial television program. \nThis book goes mo re deeply into many topics than does the television \nseries. There are topics discussed in the book which are not treated in \nthe television series and vice versa. The sequence of drawings, after \nTenniel, of Alice and her friends in high - and low -gravity \nenvironments were uncertain, at this writing, to survive the rigors of \ntelevision editing. I am delighted that these charming illustrations by \nthe artist, Brown, and the accompanying discussion have found a  \nhome here. On the other hand, explicit representations of the Cosmic \nCalendar, featured in the television series, do not appear here \u2014in part \nbecause the Cosmic Calendar is discussed in my book The Dragons of \nEden ; likewise, I do not   \nxiv \u2014 Introduction  \nhere discuss the life of Robert Goddard in much detail, because there \nis a chapter in B roca\u2019s Brain  devoted to him. But each episode of the \ntelevision series follows fairly closely the corresponding chapter of this \nbook; and I like to think that the pleasure of each will be enhanced by \nreference to the other.  \nFor clarity, I have in a number of cases introduced an idea more \nthan once \u2014the first time lightly, and with deeper passes on subsequent \nappearances. This occurs, for example, in the introduction to cosmic \nobjects in Chapter 1, which are examined in  \ngreater detail later on; or in the discussion of mutations, enzymes and \nnucleic acids in Chapter 2. In a few cases, concepts are presented out \nof historical order. For example, the ideas of the ancient Greek \nscientists are presented in Chapter 7, well afte r the discussion of \nJohannes Kepler in Chapter 3. But I believe an appreciation of the \nGreeks can best be provided after we see what they barely missed \nachieving.  \nBecause science is inseparable from the rest of the human \nendeavor, it cannot be discussed without making contact, sometimes \nglancing, sometimes head -on, with a number of social, political, \nreligious and philosophical issues. Even in the filming of a telev ision \nseries on science, the worldwide devotion to military activities \nbecomes intrusive. Simulating the exploration of Mars in the Mohave \nDesert with a full -scale version of the Viking Lander, we were \nrepeatedly interrupted by the United States Air Force,  performing \nbombing runs in a nearby test range. In Alexandria, Egypt, from nine \nto eleven A.M. every morning, our hotel was the subject of practice \nstrafing runs by the Egyptian Air Force. In Samos, Greece, permission \nto film anywhere was withheld until the very last moment because of \nNATO maneuvers and what was clearly the construction of a warren \nof under-  \nground and hillside emplacements for artillery and tanks. In \nCzechoslovakia the use of walkie -talkies for organizing the filming \nlogistics on a rural road attracted the attention of a Czech Air Force \nfighter, which circled overhead until reassured in Czech  that no threat \nto national security was being perpetrated. In Greece, Egypt and \nCzechoslovakia our film crews were accompanied everywhere by \nagents of the state security apparatus. Preliminary inquiries about \nfilming in Kaluga, U.S.S.R., for a proposed di scussion of the life of \nthe Russian pioneer of astronautics Konstantin Tsiolkovsky were \ndiscouraged \u2014because, as we later discovered, trials of dissidents were \nto be conducted there. Our camera crews met innumerable kindnesses  \nin every country we visited; but the global military presence, the fear \nin  \nthe hearts of the nations, was everywhere. The experience confirmed \nmy resolve to treat, when relevant, social questions both in the series \nand in the book.  \nThe essence of science is that it is self -correcting. New experimental \nresults and novel ideas are continually resolving old mysteries. For \nexample, in Chapter 9 we discuss the fact that the Sun   \nIntroduction  \u2014 xv \nseems to be generating too few of the elusive particles called neutrinos. \nSome proposed explanations are listed. In Chapter 10 we wonder \nwhether there is enough matter in the universe eventually to stop the \nrecession of distant galaxies, and whether the un iverse is infinitely old \nand therefore uncreated. Some light on both these questions may \nsince have been cast in experiments by Frederick Reines, of the \nUniversity of California, who be-  \nlieves he has discovered (a) that neutrinos exist in three different \nstates, only one of which could be detected by neutrino telescopes \nstudying the Sun; and (b) that neutrinos \u2014unlike light \u2014 have mass, so \nthat the gravity of all the neutrinos in space may help to close the \nCosmos and prevent it from expanding forever. Future experiments \nwill show whether these ideas are correct. But they illustrate the \ncontinuing and vigorous reassessment of received wisdom which is \nfundamental to the scientific enterprise.  \nOn a project of this magnitude it is impossible to thank everyone \nwho has made a contribution. However, I would like to acknowledge, \nespecially, B. Gentry Lee; the Cosmos production staff, including the \nsenior producers Geoffrey Haines -Stiles and David Ken nard and the \nexecutive producer Adrian Malone; the artists Jon Lomberg (who \nplayed a critical role in the original design and organization of the \nCosmos  visuals), John Allison,  \nAdolf Schaller, Rick Sternbach, Don Davis, Brown, and Anne  \nNorcia; consultants Donald Goldsmith, Owen Gingerich, Paul Fox, \nand Diane Ackerman; Cameron Beck; the KCET management, \nparticularly Greg Andorfer, who first carried KCET\u2019s pro - \nposal to us, Chuck Allen, William Lamb, and James Loper; and the \nunderwriters and co -producers of the Cosmos television series, \nincluding the Atlantic Richfield Company, the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Alfr ed P. \nSloan Foundation, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Polytel \nInternational. Others who helped in clarifying matters of fact or \napproach are listed at the back of the book. The final responsibility for \nthe content of the book is, however, of co urse mine. I thank the staff \nat Random House, particularly my editor, Anne Freedgood, and the \nbook designer, Robert Aulicino, for their capable work and their \npatience when the deadlines for the television series and the book \nseemed to be in conflict. I ow e a special debt of gratitude to Shirley \nArden, my Executive Assistant, for typing the early drafts of this book \nand ushering the later drafts through all stages of production with her \nusual cheerful competence. This is only one of many ways in which \nthe C osmos project is deeply indebted to her. I am more grateful than  \nI can say to the administration of Cornell University for granting me \na two -year leave of absence to pursue this project, to my colleagues and \nstudents there, and to my colleagues at NASA, JPL and on the Voyager \nImaging Team.  \nMy greatest debt for the writing of Cosmos is owed to Ann   \nxvi \u2014 Introduction  \nDruyan and Steven Soter, my co -writers in the television series.  \nThey made fundamental and frequent contributions to the basic ideas \nand their connections, to the overall intellectual structure of the \nepisodes, and to the felicity of style. I am deeply grateful for their \nvigorous critical readings of early versions of t his book, their \nconstructive and creative suggestions for revision through many drafts, \nand their major contributions to the television script which in many \nways influenced the content of this book. The delight I found in our \nmany discussions is one of my chief rewards from the Cosmos project.  \nIthaca and Los Angeles \nMay 1980   \n \nA small cluster of galaxies, including a spiral and an elliptical.

Our \nfeeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us \u2014there is a tingling in \nthe spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, \nof falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of \nmysteries.  \nThe size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human \nunderstanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is \nour tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human \nconcerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young \nand curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few \nmillennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected \ndiscoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations \nthat are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have \nevolv ed to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is \nprerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we \nknow this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the \nmorning sky.  \n \nThose explorations required skepticism \nand imagination both. Imagination will \noften carry us to worlds that never were. \nBut without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism \nenables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to \ntest our speculations. The Cosmos is rich \nbeyond  measure \u2014in elegant facts, in \nexquisite interrelationships, in the subtle \nmachinery of awe.   \nThe Shores of the Cosmic Ocean  \u2014 5 \n \nThe surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean.  \nFrom it we have learned most of what we know. Recently, we have \nwaded a little out to sea, enough to dampen our toes or, at most, wet \nour ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls. Some part of \nour being knows this is from where we came. We long to  return. These \naspirations are not, I think, irreverent, although they may trouble \nwhatever gods may be.  \nThe dimensions of the Cosmos are so large that using familiar units \nof distance, such as meters or miles, chosen for their utility on Earth, \nwould make little sense. Instead, we measure distance with the speed \nof light. In one second a beam of light travel s 186,000 miles, nearly  \n300,000 kilometers or seven times around the Earth. In eight minutes \nit will travel from the Sun to the Earth. We can say the Sun is eight \nlight-minutes away. In a year, it crosses nearly ten trillion kilometers, \nabout six trillion miles, of intervening sp ace. That unit of length, the \ndistance light goes in a year, is called a light -year. It measures not time \nbut distances \u2014  \nenormous distances.  \nThe Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even \na typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the \nCosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, \nuniversal vacuum, the everlasting night  of intergalactic space, a place \n \nso strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and \ngalaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted \ninto the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near \na planet would be less than one in a billion trillio n trillion* (1033, a \none followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called \ncompelling. Worlds are precious.  \nFrom an intergalactic vantage point we would see, strewn like sea \nfroth on the waves of space, innumerable faint, wispy tendrils of light. \nThese are the galaxies. Some are solitary wanderers; most inhabit \ncommunal clusters, huddling together, drifting end-   \nlessly in the great cosmic dark. Before us is the Cosmos on the grandest \nscale we know. We are in the realm of the nebulae, eight billion light -\nyears from Earth, halfway to the edge of the known universe.  \nA galaxy is composed of gas and dust and stars \u2014billions upon \nbillions of stars. Every star may be a sun to someone. Within a galaxy \nare stars and worlds and, it may be, a proliferation of living things and \nintelligent beings and spacefaring civilizations. But from afar, a galaxy \nreminds me more of a collection of lovely found objects \u2014seashells, \nperhaps, or corals, the productions of Nature laboring for aeons in the \ncosmic ocean.  \nThere are some hundred billion (1011) galaxies, each with, on   \n* We use the American scientific convention for large numbers: one billion \n= 1,000,000,000 = 109; one trillion = 1,000,000,000,000 = 1012, etc. The \nexponent counts the number of zeroes after the one.  \nExploding radio galaxy with symmetrical \njets.

In all the galaxies, there are \nperhaps as many planets as stars, 1011 \u00d7 1011 = 1022, ten billion trillion. \nIn the face of such overpowering numbers, what is the likelihood that \nonly one ordinary star, the Sun, is accompanied by an inhabited \nplanet? Why should we, tucked away in some forgotten corner of the \nCosmos, be so fortunate? To me,  it seems far more likely that the \nuniverse is brimming over with life. But we humans do not yet know. \nWe are just beginning our explor a- \ntions. From eight billion light -years away we are hard pressed to find \neven the cluster in which our Milky Way Galaxy is embedded, much \nless the Sun or the Earth. The only planet we are sure is inhabited is \na tiny speck of rock and metal, shining feebly by   \nreflected sunlight, and at this distance utterly lost.  \nBut presently our journey takes us to what astronomers on  \nEarth like to call the Local Group of galaxies.

It is a sparse and \nobscure and unpretentious cluster. One of these galaxies is M31, seen from the Earth in the constellation \nAndromeda. Like other spiral galaxies, it is a huge pinwheel of stars, \ngas and dust. M31 has two small satellites, dwarf elliptical galaxies \nbound to it by gravity, by the identical law of phy sics that tends to keep \nme in my chair. The laws of nature are the same throughout the \nCosmos. We are now two million light - years from home.  \nBeyond M31 is another, very similar galaxy, our own, its spiral arms \nturning slowly, once every quarter billion years. Now, forty thousand \nlight-years from home, we find ourselves falling toward the massive \ncenter of the Milky Way. But if we wish to find t he Earth, we must \nredirect our course to the remote outskirts of the Galaxy, to an obscure \nlocale near the edge of a distant spiral arm.  \nOur overwhelming impression, even between the spiral arms, is of \nstars streaming by us \u2014a vast array of exquisitely self -luminous stars, \n9 \nsome as flimsy as a soap bubble and so large \nthat they could contain ten thousand Suns \nor a trillion Earths; others the   \nThe Shores of the Cosmic Ocean \u2014  9 \n \n \nA globular cluster of stars, orbiting the galactic core.

Systems \nare commonly double, two stars orbiting one another.  \nBut there is a continuous gradation from triple systems through loose \nclusters of a few dozen stars to the great globular clusters, resplendent \nwith a million suns. Some double stars are so close that they touch, \nand starstuff flows between them. Most are as separated as Jupiter is \nfrom the Sun. Some stars, the supernovae, are as bright as the entire \ngalaxy that contains them; others, the black holes, are invisible from a \nfew kilometers away. Some shine with a constant brightness; others \nflicker uncertainly  or blink with an unfaltering rhythm. Some rotate \nin stately elegance; others spin so feverishly that they distort \nthemselves to oblate - ness. Most shine mainly in visible and infrared \nlight; others are  \nalso brilliant sources of X -rays or radio waves. Blue stars are hot and \nyoung; yellow stars, conventional and middle -aged; red stars, often \nelderly and dying; and small white or black stars are in the final throes \nof death. The Milky Way contains some 400 billion stars of all sorts \nmoving with a complex and orderly grace. Of all the stars, the \ninhabitants of Earth know close -up, so far, but one.  \nEach star system is an island in space, quarantined from its \nneighbors by the light -years. I can imagine creatures evolving into \nglimmerings of knowledge on innumerable worlds, every one of them \nassuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be  all that is. \nWe grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the \nCosmos.  \nSome stars may be surrounded by millions of lifeless and rocky \nworldlets, planetary systems frozen at some early stage in their \nevolution. Perhaps many stars have planetary systems rather like our \nown: at the periphery, great gaseous ringed planets and icy   \n \nA black dust cloud, and stars embedded in \ngaseous nebulosities; behind them is the \nMilky Way, edge -on.

On some, intelligent life may have evolved, \nreworking the planetary surface in some massive engineering \nenterprise. These are our brothers and sisters in the Cosmos. Are they \nvery different from us? What is their form, biochemistry, \nneurobi ology, history, politics, science, technology, art, music, \nreligion, philosophy? Perhaps some day we will know them.  \nWe have now reached our own backyard, a light -year from Earth. \nSurrounding our Sun is a spherical swarm of giant snowballs \ncomposed of ice and rock and organic molecules: the come - tary \nnuclei. Every now and then a passing star gives a tiny gravitational \ntug, and one of them obligingly careens into the  \ninner solar system. There the Sun heats it, the ice is vaporized, and a \nlovely cometary tail develops.  \nWe approach the planets of our system, largish worlds, captives of \nthe Sun, gravitationally constrained to follow nearly circular orbits, \nheated mainly by sunlight. Pluto, covered with methane ice and \naccompanied by its solitary giant moon Charon, is illum inated by a \ndistant Sun, which appears as no more than a  \nbright point of light in a pitch -black sky. The giant gas worlds, \nNeptune, Uranus, Saturn \u2014the jewel of the solar system \u2014and  \nJupiter all have an entourage of icy moons. Interior to the region of \ngassy planets and orbiting icebergs are the warm, rocky provinces of \nthe inner solar system. There is, for example, the red planet Mars, with \nsoaring volcanoes, great rift valleys, enorm ous planet -wide sandstorms, \nand, just possibly, some simple forms of life. All the planets orbit the \nSun, the nearest star, an inferno of hydrogen and helium gas engaged \nin thermonuclear reactions, flooding the solar system with light.  \nFinally, at the end of all our wanderings, we return to our tiny, \nfragile, blue -white world, lost in a cosmic ocean vast beyond our most \ncourageous imaginings. It is a world among an immensity of others. It \nmay be significant only for us. The Earth is our home, our parent. Our \nkind of life arose and evolved here. The human species is coming of \nage here.

Here there lived \na man named Eratosthenes. One of his envious contemporaries called \nhim \u201cBeta,\u201d the second letter of the Greek alphabet, because, he said, \nEratosthenes was second best in the world in everything. But it seems \nclear that in almost everything Eratosthenes was \u201cAlpha.\u201d He was an \nastronomer, historian, geograph er, philosopher, poet, theater critic \nand mathematician. The titles of the books he wrote range from \nAstronomy  to On  \nFreedom from Pain.  He was also the director of the great library of \nAlexandria, where one day he read in a papyrus book that in the \nsouthern frontier outpost of Syene, near the first cataract of the Nile, \nat noon on June 21 vertical sticks cast no shadows. On the summer \nsolstice, the longest day of the year, as the hours crept toward midday, \nthe shadows of temple columns grew shorter. At noon, they were gone. \nA reflection of the Sun could then be seen in the water at the bottom \nof a deep well. The Sun was d irectly overhead.  \nIt was an observation that someone else might easily have ignored. \nSticks, shadows, reflections in wells, the position of the Sun \u2014of what \npossible importance could such simple everyday matters be? But \nEratosthenes was a scientist, and his musings on these commonplaces \nchanged the world; in a way, they made the world. Eratosthenes had \nthe presence of mind to do an experiment, actually to observe whether \nin Alexandria vertical sticks cast shadows near noon on June 21. And, \nhe discovered, sticks do.  \nEratosthenes asked himself how, at the same moment, a stick in \nSyene could cast no shadow and a stick in Alexandria, far to the north, \ncould cast a pronounced shadow. Consider a map of ancient Egypt \nwith two vertical sticks of equal length, one stuck in Al exandria, the \nother in Syene. Suppose that, at a certain moment, each stick casts no \nshadow at all. This is perfectly easy to understand \u2014provided the Earth \nis flat. The Sun would then be directly overhead. If the two sticks cast \nshadows of equal length, th at also would make sense on a flat Earth: \nthe Sun\u2019s rays would then be inclined at the same angle to the two \nsticks. But how could it be that at the same instant there was no \nshadow at Syene and a substantial shadow at Alexandria? (See p. 16.)  \nThe only possible answer, he saw, was that the surface of the  \nEarth is curved. Not only that: the greater the curvature, the greater \nthe difference in the shadow lengths. The Sun is so far away that its \nrays are parallel when they reach the Earth. Sticks placed at different \nangles to the Sun\u2019s rays cast shadows of di fferent lengths. For the \nobserved difference in the shadow lengths, the distance between \nAlexandria and Syene had to be about seven degrees along the surface \n \nof the Earth; that is, if you imagine the \nsticks extending down to the center of the \nEarth,  The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean \u2014 21 \nthey would there intersect at an angle of seven degrees. Seven degrees \nis something like one -fiftieth of three hundred and sixty degrees, the \nfull circumference of the Earth. Eratosthenes knew that the distance \nbetween Alexandria and Syene was approximatel y 800 kilometers, \nbecause he hired a man to pace it out. Eight hundred kilometers times \n50 is 40,000 kilometers: so that must be the circumference of the \nEarth.*  \nThis is the right answer. Eratosthenes\u2019 only tools were sticks, eyes, \nfeet and brains, plus a taste for experiment. With them he deduced \nthe circumference of the Earth with an error of only a few percent, a \nremarkable achievement for 2,200 years ago. He wa s the first person \naccurately to measure the size of a planet.  \nThe Mediterranean world at that time was famous for seafaring. \nAlexandria was the greatest seaport on the planet. Once you knew the \nEarth to be a sphere of modest diameter, would you not be tempted \nto make voyages of exploration, to seek out undiscovered l ands, \nperhaps even to attempt to sail around the planet? Four hundred years \nbefore Eratosthenes, Africa had been circumnavigated by a Phoenician \nfleet in the employ of the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho. They set sail, \nprobably in frail open boats, from the Red Se a, turned down the east \ncoast of Africa up into the Atlantic, returning through the \nMediterranean. This epic journey took three years, about as long as a \nmodern Voyager  \nspacecraft takes to fly from Earth to Saturn.  \nAfter Eratosthenes\u2019 discovery, many great voyages were attempted \nby brave and venturesome sailors. Their ships were tiny. They had only \nrudimentary navigational instruments. They used dead reckoning and \nfollowed coastlines as far as they could. In an unkno wn ocean they \ncould determine their latitude, but not their longitude, by observing, \nnight after night, the position of the constellations with respect to the \nhorizon. The familiar constel-  \nlations must have been reassuring in the midst of an unexplored \nocean. The stars are the friends of explorers, then with seagoing ships \non Earth and now with spacefaring ships in the sky. After \nEratosthenes, some may have tried, but not until the time of M agellan \ndid anyone succeed in circumnavigating the Earth. What tales of \ndaring and adventure must earlier have been recounted as sailors and \nnavigators, practical men of the world,  \ngambled their lives on the mathematics of a scientist from Alexandria?  \nIn Eratosthenes\u2019 time, globes were constructed portraying the  \nEarth as viewed from space; they were essentially correct in the well -\nexplored Mediterranean but became more and more inaccu-  \nrate the farther they strayed from home. Our present knowledge of the \nCosmos shares this disagreeable but inevitable feature. In  * Or if you like to measure things in miles, \nthe distance between Alexandria and \nSyene is about 500 miles, and 500 miles \u00d7 \n50 = 25,000 miles.  \n \nOlympus Mons (Mount Olympus), a giant \nvolcanic construct, 30 kilometers high and  \n500 kilometers across, on the surface of \nMars.

But from simple \ngeometry (\u201cif two parallel straight lines are \nThe Shores of the Cosmic Ocean \u2014 22 \ntransected by a third line, the alternate interior angles are equal\u201d), angle \nB equals angle A. So by measuring the shadow length in Alexandria, \nEratosthenes concluded that Syene was A = B  \n= 7\u00b0 away on the circumference of the Earth.   \n16 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nLooking up from the bottom of the well in \nancient Syene, near present -day Abu \nSimbel, in Egypt, which according to local \ntradition is the origin of Eratosthenes\u2019 \nstudy of the circumference of the Earth.  \nthe first century, the Alexandrian \ngeographer Strabo wrote:  \nThose who have returned from an \nattempt to circumnavigate the Earth \ndo not say they have been prevented \nby an opposing continent, for the sea \nremained perfectly open, but, rather, \nthrough want of resolution and \nscarcity of provision. . . . Eratosthenes \nsays that if the extent of the At-  lantic Ocean were not an obstacle, we might easily pass by sea \nfrom Iberia to India. . . . It is quite possible that in the temperate \nzone there may be one or two habitable Earths. . . . Indeed, if \n[this other part of the world] is inhabited, it is not inh abited by \nmen such as exist in our parts, and we should have to regard it \nas another inhabited world.  \nHumans were beginning to venture, in almost every sense that matters, \nto other worlds.  \nThe subsequent exploration of the Earth was a worldwide endeavor, \nincluding voyages from as well as to China and Polynesia. The \nculmination was, of course, the discovery of America by Christopher \nColumbus and the journeys of the following few centuries, wh ich \ncompleted the geographical exploration of the Earth. Columbus\u2019 first \nvoyage is connected in the most straightforward way with the \ncalculations of Eratosthenes. Columbus was fascinated by what he \ncalled \u201cthe Enterprise of the Indies,\u201d a project to reach  Japan, China \nand India not by following the coastline of Africa and sailing East but \nrather by plunging boldly into the unknown Western ocean \u2014or, as \nEratosthenes had said with startling prescience, \u201cto pass by sea from \nIberia to India.\u201d  \nColumbus had been an itinerant peddler of old maps and an  \nA flat map of ancient Egypt. When \nthe Sun is directly overhead, vertical \nobelisks cast no shadows in \nAlexandria or in Syene.  A flat map of ancient Egypt. When \nthe Sun is not directly overhead, \nvertical obelisks cast shadows of  \nequal length in Alexandria and in Syene.  A curved map of ancient Egypt.  \nThe Sun can be directly overhead in \nSyene but not in Alexandria, thus \naccounting for the fact that the \nobelisk in Syene casts no shadow, \nwhile that in Alexandria casts a \npronounced shadow.  \nThe Shores of the Cosmic Ocean \u2014 24 \nMaps of the world. In the time of Homer, \nThe Shores of the Cosmic Ocean \u2014 25 \nthe world was thought to extend no farther \nthan the basin of the Mediterranean (which \nmeans \u201cmiddle of the Earth\u201d), surrounded \nby a world ocean. Significant improvements \nwere added by Eratosthenes  \nassiduous reader of the books by and about the ancient geographers, \nincluding Eratosthenes, Strabo and Ptolemy. But for the Enterprise of \nthe Indies to work, for ships and crews to survive the long voyage, the \nEarth had to be smaller than Eratosthenes had said. Columbus \ntherefore cheated on his calculations, as the examining faculty of the \nUniversity of Salamanca quite correctly pointed out. He used the \nsmallest possible circumference of the Earth and the greatest eastward \nextension of Asia he could find in  all the books available to him, and \nthen exaggerated even those. Had the Americas not been in the way, \nColumbus\u2019 expeditions would have failed utterly.  The Earth is now thoroughly \nexplored. It no longer promises new \ncontinents or lost lands.

The last map before \nthe disc overy of America (shown in  outline ) is The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean \u2014 26 \nthat of the Florentine astronomer Toscanelli. Columbus probably carried \nToscanelli\u2019s map with him on his first voyage.

Leaving the Earth, we are now able to view it from above, to \nsee its solid spherical shape of Eratosthenian dime n- \nsions and the outlines of its continents, confirming that many of the \nancient mapmakers were remarkably competent. What a pleasure such \na view would have given to Eratosthenes and the  \nother Alexandrian geographers.  \nIt was in Alexandria, during the six hundred years beginning \naround 300 B.C., that human beings, in an important sense, began the \nintellectual adventure that has led us to the shores of space. But of the \nlook and feel of that glorious marble city, nothing remains. \nOppression and the fear of learning have obliterated almost all \nmemor y of ancient Alexandria. Its population was marvelously \ndiverse. Macedonian and later Roman soldiers, Egyptian priests, \nGreek aristocrats, Phoenician sailors, Jewish merchants, v isitors from \nIndia and sub -Saharan Africa \u2014 everyone, except the vast slave \npopulation \u2014lived together in harmony and mutual respect for most of \nthe period of Alexandria\u2019s greatness.  \nThe city was founded by Alexander the Great and constructed by \nhis former bodyguard. Alexander encouraged respect for alien cultures \nand the open -minded pursuit of knowledge. According to tradition \u2014\nand it does not much matter whether it really happened \u2014he \ndescended beneath the Red Sea in the world\u2019s first diving bell. He \nencouraged his generals and soldiers to marry Persian and Indian \nwomen. He respected the gods of other nations. He collected exotic \nlifeforms, including an elephant for Aristotle, his teach er. His city was \nconstructed on a lavish scale, to be the world center of commerce, \nculture and learning. It was  \ngraced with broad avenues thirty meters wide, elegant architecture and \nstatuary, Alexander\u2019s monumental tomb, and an enormous \nlighthouse, the Pharos, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.  \nBut the greatest marvel of Alexandria was the library and its \nassociated museum (literally, an institution devoted to the specialties \nof the Nine Muses). Of that legendary library, the most that survives \ntoday is a dank and forgotten cellar of the Sera - peum, the library \nannex, once a temple and later reconsecrated to knowledge. A few \nmoldering shelves may be its only physical remains. Yet this place was \nonce the brain and glory of the greatest city on the planet, the first \ntrue research institute in the hi story of the world. The scholars of the \nlibrary studied the entire Cosmos. Cosmos  is a Greek word for the \norder of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos.  It implies  \nthe deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the \nintricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together. Here \nwas a community of scholars, exploring physics, literature, medicine, \nastronomy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, biol ogy, and  The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean \u2014 29 \nengineering.

And among those \ngreat men was a great woman, Hypatia, mathematician and \nastronomer, the last light of the library, whose martyrdom was bound  \nup with the destruction of the library seven centuries after its \nfounding, a story to which we will return.  \nThe Greek Kings of Egypt who succeeded Alexander were serious \nabout learning. For centuries, they supported research and \nmaintained in the library a working environment for the best minds \nof the age. It contained ten large research halls, each devoted to a  \nseparate subject; fountains and colonnades; botani-  \ncal gardens; a zoo; dissecting rooms; an observatory; and a great dining \nhall where, at leisure, was conducted the critical discussion of ideas.  \nThe heart of the library was its collection of books. The organizers \ncombed all the cultures and languages of the world. They sent agents \nabroad to buy up libraries. Commercial ships docking in Alexandria \nwere searched by the police \u2014not for contraband, but  for books. The \nscrolls were borrowed, copied and then returned to their owners. \nAccurate numbers are difficult to estimate, but it seems probable that \nthe Library contained half a million volumes, each a handwritten \npapyrus scroll. What happened to all th ose books? The classical \ncivilization that created them disintegrated, and the library itself was \ndeliberately de-  \nstroyed. Only a small fraction of its works survived, along with a few \npathetic scattered fragments. And how tantalizing those bits and \npieces are! We know, for example, that there was on the library shelves \na book by the astronomer Aristarchus of Samos, w ho argued that the \nEarth is one of the planets, which like them orbits the Sun, and that \nthe stars are enormously far away. Each of these conclusions is entirely \ncorrect, but we had to wait nearly two thousand years for their \nrediscovery. If we multiply by  a hundred thousand our sense of loss \nfor this work of Aristarchus, we begin to appreciate the grandeur of \nthe achievement of classi-  \ncal civilization and the tragedy of its destruction.  \nWe have far surpassed the science known to the ancient world.

I wonder what was in it.  \nThe ancients knew that the world is \nvery old. They sought to look into the \ndistant past. We now know that the \nCosmos is far older than they ever \nimagined.

Or are they stunningly different \u2014other \nadaptations to other environments? What else is possible? The nature \nof life on Earth and the search for life elsewhere are two sides of the \nsame question \u2014the search for who we are . \nIn the great dark between the stars there are clouds of gas and dust \nand organic matter. Dozens of different kinds of organic molecules \nhave been found there by radio telescopes. The abundance of these \nmolecules suggests that the stuff of life is everywher e. Perhaps the \norigin and evolution of life is, given enough time, a cosmic \ninevitability. On some of the billions of planets in the Milky Way \nGalaxy, life may never arise. On others, it may arise and die out, or \nnever evolve beyond its simplest forms. And  on some small fraction of \nworlds there may develop intelligences and civilizations more \nadvanced than our own.  \nOccasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is \nthat the Earth is perfectly suitable for life \u2014moderate temperatures, \nliquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, \na confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings ar e supremely well \nadapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. \nThose earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are \ndescended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on \na quite different world will doubtles s sing its praises too.  \nAll life on Earth is closely related. We have a common organic \nchemistry and a common evolutionary heritage. As a result, our \nbiologists are profoundly limited. They study only a single kind of \nbiology, one lonely theme in the music of life. Is this faint and reedy \ntune the only voice for thousands of light -years? Or is there a kind of \n \ncosmic fugue, with themes and counterpoints, dissonances and \nharmonies, a billion different voices playing the life music of the \nGalaxy?  \nLet me tell you a story about one little phrase in the music of life \non Earth. In the year 1185, the Emperor of Japan was a seven -year-old \nboy named Antoku. He was the nominal leader of   \nOne Voice in the Cosmic Fugue  \u2014 25 \na clan of samurai called the Heike, who were engaged in a long and \nbloody war with another samurai clan, the Genji. Each asserted a \nsuperior ancestral claim to the imperial throne. Their decisive naval \nencounter, with the Emperor on board ship, occurred at  Danno -ura \nin the Japanese Inland Sea on April 24, 1185. The Heike were \noutnumbered, and outmaneuvered. Many were killed. The survivors, \nin massive numbers, threw themselves into the sea and drowned. The \nLady Nii, grandmother of the Emperor, resolved that she and \nAntoku would not be cap-  \ntured by the enemy. What happened next is told in The Tale of  the \nHeike:  \nThe Emperor was seven years old that year but looked much \nolder. He was so lovely that he seemed to shed a brilliant \nradiance and his long, black hair hung loose far down his back. \nWith a look of surprise and anxiety on his face he asked the \nLady Nii, \u201cWhe re are you to take me?\u201d  \nShe turned to the youthful sovereign, with tears streaming \ndown her cheeks, and . . . comforted him, binding up his long \nhair in his dove -colored robe. Blinded with tears, the child \nsovereign put his beautiful, small hands together. He turned \nfirst to the East to say farewell to the god of Ise and then to the \nWest to repeat the Nembutsu [a prayer to the Amida Buddha]. \nThe Lady Nii took him tightly in her arms and with the words \n\u201cIn the depths of the ocean is our capitol,\u201d sank with him at last \nbeneath the w aves. \nThe entire Heike battle fleet was destroyed. Only forty -three \nwomen survived. These ladies -in-waiting of the imperial court were \nforced to sell flowers and other favors to the fishermen near the scene \nof the battle. The Heike almost vanished from history. But a ragtag \ngroup of the former ladies -in-waiting and their offspring by the \nfisherfolk established a festival to commemorate the battle. It takes \nplace on the twenty -fourth of April every year to this day. Fishermen \nwho are the descendants of the Heike d ress in hemp and black \nheadgear and proceed to the Akama shrine which contains the \nmausoleum of the drowned Emperor. There they watch a play \nportraying the events that followed the  \nBattle of Danno -ura. For centuries after, people imagined that they \ncould discern ghostly samurai armies vainly striving to bail the sea, to \ncleanse it of blood and defeat and humiliation.  \nThe fishermen say the Heike samurai wander the bottoms of the \nInland Sea still \u2014in the form of crabs. There are crabs to be found here \nwith curious markings on their backs, patterns and indentations that disturbingly resemble the face of a \nsamurai. When caught, these crabs are \nnot eaten, but are returned to the sea in \ncommemoration of the doleful events at \nDanno -ura. \nThis legend raises a lovely problem. \nHow does it come about that the face of \na warrior is incised on the carapace of a \ncrab? The answer seems to be that \nhumans made the face. The patterns on \nthe crab\u2019s shell are inherited. But among \ncrabs, as among people,   \nA samurai in the armor of feudal Japan. In \nJapanese literature, The Tale of the Heike  has \na significance comparable to that of the Iliad \nin the literature of the West. Courtesy, C.C. \nLee. \n \n \nA Heike crab from the Japanese Inland Sea.  \n61 \u2014 \n Cosmos  \nthere are many different hereditary lines. Suppose that, by chance, \namong the distant ancestors of this crab, one arose with a pattern that \nresembled, even slightly, a human face. Even before the battle of \nDanno -ura, fishermen may have been reluctant to ea t such a crab. In \nthrowing it back, they set in motion an evolutionary process: If you \nare a crab and your carapace is ordinary, the humans will eat you. Your \nline will leave fewer descendants. If your carapace looks a little like a \nface, they will throw y ou back. You will leave more descendants. Crabs \nhad a substantial investment in the patterns on their carapaces. As the \ngenerations passed, of crabs and fishermen alike, the crabs with \npatterns that most resembled a samurai face survived preferen-  \ntially until eventually there was produced not just a human face, not \njust a Japanese face, but the visage of a fierce and scowling samurai. \nAll this has nothing to do with what the crabs want.  Selection is \nimposed from the outside. The more you look like a samurai, the \nbetter are your chances of survival. Eventually, there come to be a great \nmany samurai crabs.  \nThis process is called artificial selection. In the case of the  \nHeike crab it was effected more or less unconsciously by the \nfishermen, and certainly without any serious contemplation by the \ncrabs. But humans have deliberately selected which plants and animals \nshall live and which shall die for thousands of years. We a re \nsurrounded from babyhood by familiar farm and domestic animals, \nfruits and trees and vegetables. Where do they come from? Were they \nonce free -living in the wild and then induced to adopt a less strenuous \nlife on the farm? No, the truth is quite differen t. They are, most of \nthem, made by us.  \nTen thousand years ago, there were no dairy cows or ferret hounds \nor large ears of com. When we domesticated the ancestors of these \nplants and animals \u2014sometimes creatures who looked quite different \u2014\nwe controlled their breeding. We made sure that certain va rieties, \nhaving properties we consider desirable, preferentially reproduced. \nWhen we wanted a dog to help us care for sheep, we selected breeds \nthat were intelligent, obedient and had some pre -existing talent to \nherd, which is useful for animals who hunt i n packs. The enormous \ndistended udders of dairy cattle are the result of a human interest in \nmilk and cheese. Our com, or maize, has been bred for ten thousand \ngenerations to be more tasty and nutritious than its scrawny ancestors; \nindeed, it is so changed  that it cannot even reproduce without human \nintervention.  62 \u2014 \nThe essence of artificial selection \u2014for a Heike crab, a dog, a cow or \nan ear of com \u2014is this: Many physical and behavioral traits of plants \nand animals are inherited. They breed true. Humans, for  \nwhatever reason, encourage the reproduction of some varieties and \ndiscourage the reproduction of others. The variety selected for \npreferentially reproduces; it eventually becomes abundant; the variety \nselected against becomes rare and perhaps extinct.   \nOne Voice in the Cosmic Fugue \u2014 27 \nBut if humans can make new varieties of plants and animals, must \nnot nature do so also? This related process is called natural selection. \nThat life has changed fundamentally over the aeons is entirely clear \nfrom the alterations we have made in the beasts a nd vegetables during \nthe short tenure of humans on Earth, and from the fossil evidence. \nThe fossil record speaks to us unambiguously of creatures that once \nwere present in enormous numbers and that have now vanished \nutterly.* Far more species have become e xtinct in the history of the \nEarth than exist today; they are the terminated experiments of \nevolution.  \nThe genetic changes induced by domestication have occurred very \nrapidly. The rabbit was not domesticated until early medieval times (it \nwas bred by French monks in the belief that new-  \nborn bunnies were fish and therefore exempt from the prohibitions \nagainst eating meat on certain days in the Church calendar); coffee in \nthe fifteenth century; the sugar beet in the nineteenth century; and \nthe mink is still in the earliest stages of  \ndomestication. In less than ten thousand years, domestication has \nincreased the weight of wool grown by sheep from less than one \nkilogram of rough hairs to ten or twenty kilograms of uniform, fine \ndown; or the volume of milk given by cattle during a lactat ion period \nfrom a few hundred to a million cubic centimeters. If artificial \nselection can make such major changes in so short a period of time, \nwhat must natural selection, working over billions of years, be capable \nof? The answer is all the beauty and div ersity of the biological world. \nEvolution is a fact, not a theory.  \nThat the mechanism of evolution is natural selection is the great \ndiscovery associated with the names of Charles Darwin and Alfred \nRussel Wallace. More than a century ago, they stressed that nature is \nprolific, that many more animals and plants are born th an can possibly \nsurvive and that therefore the environment selects those varieties \nwhich are, by accident, better suited for survival. Mutations \u2014sudden \nchanges in heredity \u2014breed true. They provide the raw material of \nevolution. The environment selects thos e few mutations that enhance \nsurvival, resulting in a series of slow transformations of one lifeform \ninto another, the origin of new species.1 \n \n1 In the Mayan holy book the Popol Vuh, the various forms of life are described as \nunsuccessful attempts by gods with a predilection for ex-  \nperiment to make people. Early tries were far off the mark, creating the lower \nanimals; the penultimate attempt, a near miss, made the monkeys. In Chinese \nmyth, human beings arose from the body lice of a god named   \n \n* Although traditional Western religious opinion stoutly maintained the \ncontrary, as for example, the 1770 opinion of John Wesley: \u201cDeath is never \npermitted to destroy [even] the most inconsiderable species.\u201d  \n \nPan Ku. In the eighteenth century, de Buffon proposed that the Earth was \nmuch older than Scripture suggested, that the forms of life somehow changed \nslowly over the millennia, but that the apes were the forlorn  \n65 \u2014 Cosmos  \nDarwin\u2019s words in The Origin of Species  were:  \nMan does not actually produce variability; he only \nunintentionally exposes organic beings to new conditions of life, \nand then Nature acts on the organisation, and causes varia-  \nbility. But man can and does select the variations given to him \nby Nature, and thus accumulate them in any desired manner. \nHe thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or \npleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it \nunconsciously by pres erving the individuals most useful to him \nat the time, without any thought of altering the breed. . . . There \nis no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so \nefficiently under domestication should not have acted under \nNature. . . . More individ uals are born than can possibly survive. \n. . . The slightest advantage in one being, of any age or during \nany season, over those with which it comes into competition, or \nbetter adaptation  \nin however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, \nwill turn the balance.  \nT. H. Huxley, the most effective nineteenth -century defender and \npopularizer of evolution, wrote that the publications of Darwin and \nWallace were a \u201cflash of light, which to a man who has lost himself in \na dark night, suddenly reveals a road which, whether  it takes him \nstraight home or not, certainly goes his way. . . . My reflection, when I \nfirst made myself master of the central idea of the \u2018Origin of Species,\u2019 \nwas, \u2018How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\u2019 I suppose \nthat Columbus\u2019 companions sa id much the same. . . . The facts of \nvariability, of the struggle for existence, of adaptation to conditions, \nwere notorious enough; but none of us had suspected that the road to \nthe heart of the species problem lay through them, until Darwin and  \nWallace dispelled the darkness.\u201d  \nMany people were scandalized \u2014some still are \u2014at both ideas, \nevolution and natural selection. Our ancestors looked at the elegance \nof life on Earth, at how appropriate the structures of organisms are to \ntheir functions, and saw evidence for a Great Designer.  The simplest \none-celled organism is a far more complex machine than the finest \npocket watch. And yet pocket watches do not spontaneously self -\nassemble, or evolve, in slow stages, on their own, from, say, \ngrandfather clocks. A watch implies a watchmaker. T here seemed to \nbe no way in which atoms and molecules could somehow \nspontaneously fall together to create organisms of such awesome \ncomplexity and subtle functioning as grace every region of the Earth. \nThat each living thing was specially designed, that on e species did not 66 \u2014 Cosmos  \nbecome another, were notions   perfectly   consistent   with  what  our  \nancestors  with  their  \n \ndescendants of people. While these notions do not precisely reflect the \nevolutionary process described by Darwin and Wallace, they are \nanticipations of it \u2014as are the views of Democritus, Empedocles and other \nearly Ionian scientists who are discussed in Cha pter 7.  \n \nOne Voice in the Cosmic Fugue \u2014 29 \nlimited historical records knew about life. The idea that every \norganism was meticulously constructed by a Great Designer provided \na significance and order to nature and an importance to human beings \nthat we crave still. A Designer is a natural, appealing and altogether \nhuman explanation of the biological world. But, as Darwin and \nWallace showed, there is another way, equally appealing, equally \nhuman, and far more compelling: natural selection, which makes the \nmusic of life more beautiful as  \nthe aeons pass.  \nThe fossil evidence could be consistent with the idea of a  \nGreat Designer; perhaps some species are destroyed when the  \nDesigner becomes dissatisfied with them, and new experiments are \nattempted on an improved design. But this notion is a little \ndisconcerting. Each plant and animal is exquisitely made; should not \na supremely competent Designer have been able to make the int ended \nvariety from the start? The fossil record implies trial and error, an \ninability to anticipate the future, features inconsistent with an efficient \nGreat Designer (although not with a Designer of a more remote and \nindirect temperament).  \nWhen I was a college undergraduate in the early 1950\u2019s, I was \nfortunate enough to work in the laboratory of H. J. Muller, a great \ngeneticist and the man who discovered that radiation produces \nmutations. Muller was the person who first called my attention t o the \nHeike crab as an example of artificial selection. To learn the practical \nside of genetics, I spent many months working with fruit flies, \nDrosophila melanogaster  (which means the black -bodied dew -lover) \u2014\ntiny benign beings with two wings and big eyes. We kept them in pint \nmilk bottles. We would cross  \ntwo varieties to see what new forms emerged from the rearrangement \nof the parental genes, and from natural and induced mutations. The \nfemales would deposit their eggs on a kind of molasses the technicians \nplaced inside the bottles; the bottles were stopper ed; and we would \nwait two weeks for the fertilized eggs to become larvae, the larvae \npupae, and the pupae to emerge as new adult fruit flies.  \nOne day I was looking through a low -power binocular microscope \nat a newly arrived batch of adult Drosophila  immobilized with a little \nether, and was busily separating the different varieties with a camel\u2019s -\nhair brush. To my astonishment, I came upon something very \ndifferent: not a small variation such as red eyes instead of white, or \nneck bristles instead of no  neck bristles. This was another, and very \nwell-functioning, kind of creature with much more prominent wings \nand long feathery antennae. Fate   \nhad arranged, I concluded, that an example of a major evolutionary \nchange in a single generation, the very thing Muller had said could \nnever happen, should take place in his own laboratory.  \nIt was my unhappy task to explain it to him.  \nWith heavy heart I knocked on his office door. \u201cCome in,\u201d came the \nmuffled cry. I entered to discover the room darkened  69 \u2014 Cosmos  \nexcept for a single small lamp illuminating the stage of the microscope \nat which he was working. In these gloomy surroundings I stumbled \nthrough my explanation. I had found a very different kind of fly. I was \nsure it had emerged from one of the pupae in th e molasses. I didn\u2019t \nmean to disturb Muller but .. . \u201cDoes it look more like Lepidoptera \nthan Diptera?\u201d he asked, his face illuminated from below. I didn\u2019t \nknow what this meant, so he had to explain: \u201cDoes it have big wings? \nDoes it have feathery antennae? \u201d I glumly nodded assent.  \nMuller switched on the overhead light and smiled benignly. It was \nan old story. There was a kind of moth that had adapted to Drosophila  \ngenetics laboratories. It was nothing like a fruit fly and wanted nothing \nto do with fruit flies. What it wanted was the fruit flies\u2019 molasses. In \nthe brief time that the laboratory technician took to unstopper and \nstopper the milk bottle \u2014for example, to add fruit flies \u2014the mother \nmoth made a dive -bombing pass, dropping her eggs on the run into \nthe tasty molasses. I had not  discovered a macro -mutation. I had \nmerely stumbled upon another lovely adaptation in nature, itself the \nproduct of micromu-  \ntation and natural selection.  \nThe secrets of evolution are death and time \u2014the deaths of \nenormous numbers of lifeforms that were imperfectly adapted to the \nenvironment; and time for a long succession of small mutations that \nwere by accident  adaptive, time for the slow accumulation of patterns \nof favorable mutations. Part of the resistance to Darwin and Wallace \nderives from our difficulty in imagining the passage of the millennia, \nmuch less the aeons. What does seventy million years mean to b eings \nwho live only one -millionth as long? We a re like butterflies who flutter \nfor a day and think it is forever.  \nWhat happened here on Earth may be more or less typical of the \nevolution of life on many worlds; but in such details as the chemistry \nof proteins or the neurology of brains, the story of life on Earth may \nbe unique in all the Milky Way Galaxy. The Earth co ndensed out of \ninterstellar gas and dust some 4.6 billion years ago. We know from the \nfossil record that the origin of life happened soon after, perhaps \naround 4.0 billion years ago, in the ponds and oceans of the primitive \nEarth. The first living things w ere not anything so complex as a one -\ncelled organism, already a highly sophisticated form of life. The first \nstirrings were much more humble. In those early days, lightning and \nultraviolet light from the Sun were breaking apart the simple \nhydrogen -rich mol ecules of the primitive atmosphere, the fragments \nspontaneously recombining into more and more complex molecules. \nThe products of this early chemistry were dissolved in the oceans, \nforming a kind of organic soup of gradually increasing complexity, 70 \u2014 Cosmos  \nuntil one day, quite by accident, a molecule arose that was able to \nmake crude copies of itself, using as building blocks other molecules   \nOne Voice in the Cosmic Fugue \u2014 31 \nin the soup. (We will return to this subject later.)  \nThis was the earliest ancestor of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, the \nmaster molecule of life on Earth. It is shaped like a ladder twisted into \na helix, the rungs available in four different molecular parts, which \nconstitute the four letters of the genetic cod e. These rungs, called \nnucleotides, spell out the hereditary instructions for making a given \norganism. Every lifeform on Earth has a different set of instructions, \nwritten out in essentially the same language. The reason organisms are \ndifferent is the diff erences in their nucleic acid instructions. A \nmutation is a change in a nucleotide, copied in the next generation, \nwhich breeds true. Since mutations are random  nucleotide changes, \nmost of them are harmful or lethal, coding into existence \nnonfunctional enzymes. It is a long wait before a mutation makes an \norganism work better. And yet it is that improbable event, a small \nbeneficial mutation in a nucleotide a ten -millionth of a centimeter \nacross, that makes evolution go.  \nFour billion years ago, the Earth was a molecular Garden of Eden. \nThere were as yet no predators. Some molecules reproduced \nthemselves inefficiently, competed for building blocks and left crude \ncopies of themselves. With reproduction, mutation and the sele ctive \nelimination of the least efficient varieties, evolution was well under \nway, even at the molecular level. As time went on, they got better at \nreproducing. Molecules with specialized functions eventually joined \ntogether, making a kind of molecular coll ective \u2014the first cell. Plant \ncells today have tiny molecular factories, called chloroplasts, which are \nin charge of photosynthesis \u2014the conversion of sunlight, water and \ncarbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The cells in a drop of \nblood contain a di fferent sort of molecular factory, the \nmitochondrion, which combines food with oxygen to extract useful \nenergy. These factories exist in plant and animal cells today but may \nonce themselves have been free -living cells.  \nBy three billion years ago, a number of one -celled plants had joined \ntogether, perhaps because a mutation prevented a single cell from \nseparating after splitting in two. The first multicellular organisms had \nevolved. Every cell of your body is a kind of co mmune, with once free -\nliving parts all banded together for the common good. And you are \nmade of a hundred trillion cells. We are, each of us, a multitude.  \nSex seems to have been invented around two billion years ago. \nBefore then, new varieties of organisms could arise only from the \naccumulation of random mutations \u2014the selection of changes, letter by \nletter, in the genetic instructions. Evolution must have be en \nagonizingly slow. With the invention of sex, two organisms could  \nexchange whole paragraphs, pages and books of their DNA code, \nproducing new varieties ready for the sieve of selection. Organisms are \nselected to engage in sex \u2014the ones that find it uninteresting quickly \nbecome extinct. And this is true not only  73 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \n \nTrilobite fossils. At top, three blind \nspecimens from half a billion years ago. In \ncenter and bottom are later, more highly \nevolved specimens, with their eyes beautifully \npreserved.

We humans also have a \npalpable devotion to exchanging segments of DNA today.  \nBy one billion years ago, plants, working cooperatively, had made a \nstunning change in the environment of the Earth. Green plants \ngenerate molecular oxygen. Since the oceans were by now filled with \nsimple green plants, oxygen was becoming a major constitue nt of the \nEarth\u2019s atmosphere, altering it irreversibly from its original hydrogen -\nrich character and ending the epoch of Earth history when the stuff \nof life was made by nonbiological processes. But oxygen tends to make \norganic molecules fall to pieces. De spite our fondness for it, it is \nfundamentally a poison for unprotected organic matter. The \ntransition to an oxidizing atmosphere posed a supreme crisis in the \nhistory of life, and a great many organisms, unable to cope with \noxygen, perished. A few primiti ve forms, such as the botulism and \ntetanus bacilli, manage to survive even today only in oxygen -free \nenvironments. The nitrogen in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is much more \nchemically inert and therefore much more benign than oxygen. But it, \ntoo, is biologically  sustained. Thus, 99 percent of the Earth\u2019s \natmosphere is of biological origin. The sky is made by life.  \nFor most of the four billion years since the origin of life, the \ndominant organisms were microscopic blue -green algae, which \ncovered and filled the oceans. Then some 600 million years ago, the \nmonopolizing grip of the algae was broken and an enormous \nproli feration of new lifeforms emerged, an event called the Cambrian \nexplosion. Life had arisen almost immediately after the origin of the \nEarth, which suggests that life may be an inevitable chemical process \non an Earth -like planet. But life did not evolve muc h beyond blue -\ngreen algae for three billion years, which suggests that large lifeforms \nwith specialized organs are hard to evolve, harder even than the origin \nof life. Perhaps there are many other planets that today have abundant \nmicrobes but no big beasts  and vegetables.  \nSoon after the Cambrian explosion, the oceans teemed with many \ndifferent forms of life. By 500 million years ago there were vast herds \nof trilobites, beautifully constructed animals, a little like large insects; \nsome hunted in packs on the ocean floor. The y stored crystals in their \neyes to detect polarized light. But there are no trilobites alive today; \nthere have been none for 200 million years. The Earth used to be \ninhabited by plants and animals of which there is today no living trace. \nAnd of course ever y species now on the planet once did not exist. \nThere is no hint in the old rocks of animals like us. Species appear, \nabide more or less briefly and then flicker out.  \nBefore the Cambrian explosion species seem to have succeeded one \nanother rather slowly. In part this may be because the richness of our \ninformation declines rapidly the farther into the past we peer; in the \n74 \u2014 Cosmos  \nearly history of our planet, few organisms \nhad hard parts and soft beings leave few \nfossil remains. But in part the   \nOne Voice in the Cosmic Fugue \u2014 33 \nsluggish rate of appearance of dramatically new forms before the  \nCambrian explosion is real; the painstaking evolution of cell structure \nand biochemistry is not immediately reflected in the external forms \nrevealed by the fossil record. After the Cambrian explosion, exquisite \nnew adaptations followed one another with  \ncomparatively breathtaking speed. In rapid succession, the first fish \nand the first vertebrates appeared; plants, previously re-  \nstricted to the oceans, began the colonization of the land; the first \ninsect evolved, and its descendants became the pioneers in the \ncolonization of the land by animals; winged insects arose together \nwith the amphibians, creatures something like the lungfi sh, able to \nsurvive both on land and in the water; the first trees and the first \nreptiles appeared; the dinosaurs evolved; the mammals emerged, and \nthen the first birds; the first flowers appeared; the dinosaurs became \nextinct; the earliest cetaceans, ance stors to the dolphins and whales, \narose and in the same period the primates \u2014the ancestors of the \nmonkeys, the apes and the humans. Less than ten million years ago, \nthe first creatures who closely resembled human beings evolved, \naccompanied by a spectacular  increase in brain size. And then, only a \nfew million years ago, the first true humans emerged.  \nHuman beings grew up in forests; we have a natural affinity for \nthem. How lovely a tree is, straining toward the sky. Its leaves harvest \nsunlight to photosynthesize, so trees compete by shadowing their \nneighbors. If you look closely you can often see two t rees pushing and \nshoving with languid grace. Trees are great and beautiful machines, \npowered by sunlight, taking in water from the ground and carbon \ndioxide from the air, converting these materials into food for their use \nand ours. The plant uses the carbo hydrates it makes as an energy \nsource to go about its planty business. And we animals, who are \nultimately parasites on the plants, steal the carbohydrates so we can \ngo about our business. In earing the plants we combine the \ncarbohydrates with oxygen dissol ved in our blood because of our \npenchant for breathing air, and so extract the energy that makes us \ngo. In the process we exhale carbon dioxide, which the plants then  \nrecycle to make more carbohydrates. What a marvelous cooperative \narrangement \u2014plants and animals each inhaling the other\u2019s \nexhalations, a kind of planet -wide mutual mouth -to-stoma \nresuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million \nkilomet ers  \naway.  \nThere are tens of billions of known kinds of organic molecules. Yet \nonly about fifty of them are used for the essential activities of life. The \nsame patterns are employed over and over again, conservatively, \ningeniously for different functions. And at the very heart of life on \nEarth \u2014the proteins that control cell  \nchemistry, and the nucleic acids that carry the hereditary \ninstructions \u2014we find these molecules to be essentially identical in all \nthe plants and animals. An oak tree and I are made of the same stuff.  \n \nClose relatives: an oak tree and a human.  \n \n34 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nPhotomicrograph of human blood cells, \ncourtesy D. Golde, UCLA. The doughnut -\nshaped cells are normal red blood cells, \nwhich carry oxygen. The larger clumps are \nwhite blood cells, which engulf foreign \nmicroorganisms.  \nIf you go far enough back, we have a \ncommon ancestor.  \nThe living cell is a regime as complex and \nbeautiful as the realm of the galaxies and \nthe stars. The elaborate machinery of the \ncell has been painstakingly evolved over \nfour billion years. Fragments of food are \ntransmogrified into cellular machinery.  \nToday\u2019s white blood cell is yesterday\u2019s \ncreamed spinach. How does the cell do it? \nInside is a labyrinthine and subtle \narchitecture that maintains its own \nstructure, transforms molecules, stores \nenergy and prepares for self -replication. If \nwe could enter a cell, many of the molecular \nspecks we would see would be protein \nmolecules, some in frenzied activity, others \nmerely waiting. The most important \nproteins are enzymes, molecules that \ncontrol the cell\u2019s chemical reactions. \nEnzymes are like assembly -line work ers, \neach specializing in a particular molecular \njob: Step 4 in the construction of the \nnucleotide guanosine phosphate, say, or \nStep 11 in the dismantling of a molecule of sugar to extract energy, the currency that pays for getting the other \ncellular jobs done. But the enzymes do not run the show. They receive \ntheir instructions \u2014and are in fact themselves constructed \u2014on orders \nsent from those in charge. The boss molecules ar e the nucleic acids. \nThey live sequestered in a forbidden city in the deep interior,  in the \nnucleus of the cell.  \nIf we plunged through a pore into the nucleus of the cell, we would \nfind something that resembles an explosion in a spaghetti factory \u2014a \ndisorderly multitude of coils and strands, which are the two kinds of \nnucleic acids: DNA, which knows what to do, and RN A, which \nconveys the instructions issued by DNA to the rest of the cell. These \nare the best that four billion years of evolution could produce, \ncontaining the full complement of information on how to make a cell, \na tree or a human work. The amount of infor mation in human DNA, \nif written out in ordinary language, would occupy a hundred thick \nvolumes. What is more, the DNA molecules know how to make, with \nonly very rare exceptions, identical copies of themselves. They know \nextraordinarily much.  \nDNA is a double helix, the two intertwined strands resembling a \n\u201cspiral\u201d staircase. It is the sequence or ordering of the nucleotides \nalong either of the constituent strands that is the language of life. \nDuring reproduction, the helices separate, assisted by a special \nunwinding protein, each synthesizing an identical copy of the other \nfrom nucleotide building blocks floating about nearby in the viscous \nliquid of the cell nucleus. Once the unwinding is underway, a \nremarkable enzyme called DNA polymerase help s ensure that the \ncopying works almost perfectly. If a mistake is made, there are enzymes \nwhich snip the mistake out and replace the wrong nucleotide by the \nright one.

When all is done, a single \nenzyme molecule has been produced, which then goes a bout ordering \none particular aspect of the chemistry of the cell.  \nHuman DNA is a ladder a billion nucleotides long. Most possible \ncombinations of nucleotides are nonsense: they would cause the \nsynthesis of proteins that perform no useful function. Only an \nextremely limited number of nucleic acid molecules are any good fo r \nlifeforms as complicated as we. Even so, the number of useful ways of \nputting nucleic acids together is stupefyingly large \u2014probably far \ngreater than the total number of electrons and protons in the universe. \nAccordingly, the number of possible individual  human beings is vastly \ngreater than the number that have ever lived: the untapped potential \nof the human species is immense. There must be ways of putting \nnucleic acids together that will function far better \u2014by any criterion we \nchoose \u2014than any human being  who has ever lived. Fortunately, we do \nnot yet know how to assemble alternative sequences of nucleotides to \nmake alternative kinds of human beings. In the future we may well be \nable to assemble nucleotides in any desired sequence, to produce \nwhatever char acteristics we think desirable \u2014a sobering and disquieting \nprospect.  \nEvolution works through mutation and selection. Mutations might \noccur during replication if the enzyme DNA polymerase makes a \nmistake. But it rarely makes a mistake. Mutations also occur because \nof radioactivity or ultraviolet light from the Sun or cosmic rays or \nchemicals in the environment, all of which can change the nucleotides \nor tie the nucleic acids up in knots. If the mutation rate is too high, \nwe lose the inheritance of four billion years of painstaking evolution. \nIf it is too low, new varieties wi ll not be available to adapt to some \nfuture change in the environment. The evolution of life requires a \nmore or less precise balance between mutation and selection. When \nthat balance is achieved, remarkable adaptations occur.  \nA change in a single DNA nucleotide causes a change in a single \namino acid in the protein for which that DNA codes. The red blood \ncells of people of European descent look roughly globular. The red \nblood cells of some people of African descent look like sic kles or \ncrescent moons. Sickle cells carry less oxygen and  \nconsequently transmit a kind of anemia. They also provide major \nresistance against malaria. There is no question that it is better to be \nanemic than to be dead. This major influence on the function of the \nblood \u2014so striking as to be readily apparent in phot ographs of red blood cells \u2014is the result of a change in a \nsingle nucleotide out of the ten billion in \n \nthe DNA of a typical human cell. We are still ignorant of the \nconsequences of changes in most of the other nucleotides.  \nScanning electron micrographs at successively higher magnifications of \nhuman blood cells.

Cells are \ncharacteristically about 100 micrometers ( \u00b5m) across (=0.1 millimeters, the smallest object the human eye can see unaided). \nPassing through the cell membrane, about 0.01 \u00b5m thick, we encounter ropy extensions of the membrane ( a), called the \nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) which plays a major role in the architecture of the cell. Within the cytoplasm (b), we see a few of \nthe numerous ribosomes (e.g., the cluster of five dark globules), some attached to proteins or messenger RNA, sent from the \nDNA in the nucleus. Ribosomes are about 0.02 \u00b5m across. The thr eads are microtubules, coursing toward the nucleus (light \nblue, in background). Shaped like sausages, the mitochondria (b, c), about 1 \u00b5m thick and 10 \u00b5m long, power the cell. They \nhave their own DNA; their ancestors may once have been free -living microbes. The ER is connected to the cell nucleus ( c, d). \nWhen we plunge through a tunnel -like pore (0.05 \u00b5m across) in the nuclear membrane ( e), we emerge into the nucleus ( f), \nfilled with strands of DNA, and resembling \u201can explosion in a spaghetti factory.\u201d Five  full turns of twists of each DNA helix \nare shown in (g), corresponding to about 4,000 constituent atoms. One full molecule of human DNA has about a hundred \nmillion such twists and about a hundred billion atoms, as many as the number of stars in a typical galaxy. One such twist is \nseen in ( h). Each of the two green strands marks the backbone of the molecule, made of alternating sugars and phosphates. \nShown in yellow, buff, red, and brown are the nitrogen -containing nucleotide bases that form the links or cr oss-struts between \nthe two  \nhelices. (They represent molecules called adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine. Adenine bonds only with thymine; guanine \nbonds only with cytosine.) The language of life is determined by the sequence of nucleotide bases. The individual spheres in \nthis pre cise model correspond to atoms of hydrogen (the smallest), carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus. The DNA \nunwinding enzyme (called a helicase), in blue (i), supervises the breaking of chemical bonds between adjacent nucleotide bases \npreparatory to DNA re production: A molecule of the enzyme DNA polymerase (blue) supervises the attachment of nearby \nbuilding blocks onto one of the strands of DNA ( j). Each strand of an original double helix copies the other in DNA self -\n \nreplication. When an arriving nucleotide does not match its partner, DNA polymerase removes it, an activity that molecular \nbiologists call \u201cproofreading.\u201d A rare proofreading error makes a mutation: the genetic instructions have been changed. A \ntypical hum an DNA polymerase will add a few dozen nucleotides every second. Ten thousand of them may be working on a \nDNA molecule at any given moment during its replication.

A \ntransparent mixture of the gases methane, \nammonia, hydrogen sulfide and water begins \nto be sparked in a glass flask (top). After a few \nhours of sparking, the interior of the flask is \ncoated ( bottom ) with a rich variety of organic \nmolecules relevant for the origin of life. \nCourtesy Bi - shun Khare.  \nWe humans look rather different than a \ntree. Without a doubt we perceive the \nworld differently than a tree does. But \ndown  \ndeep, at the molecular heart of life, the \ntrees and we are essentially identical. We \nboth use nucleic acids for heredity; we both \nuse proteins as enzymes to control the \nchemistry of our cells. Most significantly, \nwe both use precisely the same code book \nfor translating nucleic acid information \ninto protein information, as do virtually all \nthe other creatures on the planet.* The \nusual explanation of this molecular unity is \nthat we are, all of us \u2014trees and people, angler fish and slime molds and paramecia \u2014descended from a single \nand common instance of the origin of life in the early history of our \nplanet. How did the critical molecules then arise?  \nIn my laboratory at Cornell University we work on, among other \nthings, prebiological organic chemistry, making some notes of the \nmusic of life. We mix together and spark the gases of the primitive \nEarth: hydrogen, water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide \u2014all \npresent, incidentally, on the planet Jupiter today and throughout the \nCosmos. The sparks correspond to lightning \u2014 also present on the \nancient Earth and on modern Jupiter. The reaction vessel is initially \ntransparent: the precursor gases are entirely i nvisible. But after ten \nminutes of sparking, we see a strange brown pigment slowly streaking \nthe sides of the vessel. The interior gradually becomes opaque, covered \nwith a thick brown tar. If we had used ultraviolet light \u2014simulating the \nearly Sun \u2014the resul ts would have been more or less the same. The tar \nis an extremely rich collection of complex organic molecules, including \nthe constituent parts of proteins and nucleic acids. The stuff of life, it \nturns out, can be very easily made.  \nSuch experiments were first performed in the early 1950\u2019s by  \nStanley Miller, then a graduate student of the chemist Harold Urey. \nUrey had argued compellingly that the early atmosphere of the Earth \nwas hydrogen -rich, as is most of the Cosmos; that the hydrogen has \nsince trickled away to space from Earth, but not  \nfrom massive Jupiter; and that the origin of life occurred before the \nhydrogen was lost. After Urey suggested that such gases be sparked, \nsomeone asked him what he expected to make in such an experiment. \nUrey replied, \u201cBeilstein.\u201d Beilstein  is the massive  \n* The genetic code turns out to be not quite identical in all parts of all \norganisms on the Earth. At least a few cases are known where the \ntranscription from DNA information into protein information in a \nmitochondrion employs a different code book from th at used by the genes \nin the nucleus of the very same cell. This points to a long evolutionary \nseparation of the genetic codes of mitochondria and nuclei, and is \nconsistent with the idea that mitochondria were once free -living organisms \nincorporated into th e cell in a symbiotic relationship billions of years ago. \nThe development and emerging sophistication of that symbiosis is, \nincidentally, one answer to the question of what evolution was doing \nbetween the origin of the cell and the proliferation of many -celled \norganisms in the Cambrian explosion.   \nOne Voice in the Cosmic Fugue \u2014 39 \nGerman compendium in 28 volumes, listing all the organic molecules \nknown to chemists.  \nUsing only the most abundant gases that were present on the early \nEarth and almost any energy source that breaks chemical bonds, we \ncan produce the essential building blocks of life. But in our vessel are \nonly the notes of the music of life \u2014not the music i tself. The molecular \nbuilding blocks must be put together in the correct sequence. Life is \ncertainly more than the amino acids that make up its proteins and the \nnucleotides that make up its nucleic acids. But even in ordering these \nbuilding blocks into lon g-chain molecules, there has been substantial \nlaboratory progress. Amino acids have been assembled under \nprimitive Earth conditions into molecules resembling proteins. Some \nof them feebly control useful chemical reactions, as enzymes do. \nNucleotides have b een put  \ntogether into strands of nucleic acid a few dozen units long. Under \nthe right circumstances in the test tube, short nucleic acids can \nsynthesize identical copies of themselves.  \nNo one has so far mixed together the gases and waters of the \nprimitive Earth and at the end of the experiment had something crawl \nout of the test tube. The smallest living things known, the viroids, are \ncomposed of less than 10,000 atoms. They cause severa l different \ndiseases in cultivated plants and have probably most recently evolved \nfrom more complex organisms rather than from simpler ones. Indeed, \nit is hard to imagine a still simpler organism that is in any sense alive. \nViroids are composed exclusively  of nucleic acid, unlike the viruses, \nwhich also have a protein coat. They are no more than a single strand \nof RNA with either a linear or a closed circular geometry. Viroids can \nbe so small and still thrive because they are thoroughgoing, \nunremitting para sites. Like viruses, they simply take over the \nmolecular machinery of a much larger, well -functioning cell and \nchange it from a factory for making more cells into a factory for \nmaking more viroids.  \nThe smallest known free -living organisms are the PPLO  \n(pleuropneumonia -like organisms) and similar small beasts. They are \ncomposed of about fifty million atoms. Such organisms, having to be \nmore self -reliant, are also more complicated than viroids and viruses. \nBut the environment of the Earth today is not ext remely favorable for \nsimple forms of life. You have to work hard to make a living. You have \nto be careful about predators. In the early history of our planet, \nhowever, when enormous amounts of organic molecules were being \nproduced by sunlight in a hydrogen -rich atmosphere, very simple, \nnonparasitic organisms had a fighting chance. The first living things  \nmay have been something like free -living viroids only a few hundred \nnucleotides long. Experimental work on making such creatures from \nscratch may begin by the end of the century. There is still much to be \nunderstood about the origin of life, including the origin of the genetic \ncode. But we have been performing such experiments for   \n40 \u2014 Cosmos  \n A science fiction alien by Edd Cartier. Compare with the scanning \nelectron micrograph of a terrestrial mite, shown as the frontispiece of \nthis chapter. Source: Ham - lyn Group Picture Library.  \nonly some thirty years. Nature has had a four -billion -year head start. \nAll in all, we have not done badly.  \nNothing in such experiments is unique to the Earth. The initial \ngases, and the energy sources, are common throughout the Cosmos. \nChemical reactions like those in our laboratory vessels may be \nresponsible for the organic matter in interstellar space and the  amino \nacids found in meteorites. Some similar chemistry must have occurred \non a billion other worlds in the Milky Way Galaxy. The molecules of \nlife fill the Cosmos.  \nBut even if life on another planet has the same molecular chemistry \nas life here, there is no reason to expect it to resemble familiar \norganisms. Consider the enormous diversity of living things on Earth, \nall of which share the same planet and an identical  molecular biology. \nThose other beasts and vegetables are probably radically different from \nany organism we know here. There may be some convergent evolution \nbecause there may be only one best solution to a certain \nenvironmental problem \u2014something like two eyes, for example, for \nbinocular vision at optical frequencies. But in general the random \ncharacter of the evolutionary process should create extraterrestrial \ncreatures very different from any that we know.  \nI cannot tell you what an extraterrestrial being would look like.  \nI am terribly limited by the fact that I know only one kind of life, life \non Earth. Some people \u2014science fiction writers and artists, for \ninstance \u2014have speculated on what other beings might be like. I am \nskeptical about most of those extraterrestrial vision s. They seem to me \nto rely too much on forms of life we already know. Any given organism \nis the way it is because of a long series of individually unlikely steps. I \ndo not think life anywhere else would look very much like a reptile, or \nan insect or a huma n- even with such minor cosmetic adjustments as \ngreen skin, pointy ears and antennae. But if you pressed me, I could \ntry to imagine something rather different:  \nOn a giant gas planet like Jupiter, with an atmosphere rich in \nhydrogen, helium, methane, water and ammonia, there is no \naccessible solid surface, but rather a dense, cloudy atmosphere in \nwhich organic molecules may be falling from the skies like manna \nfrom heaven, like the products of our laboratory experiments. \nHowever, there is a characteristic impediment to life on such a planet: \nthe atmosphere is turbulent, and down deep it is very hot. An \norganism must be careful that it is not carried down and fried.  \nTo show that life is not out of the question in such a very different \nplanet, my Cornell colleague E. E. Salpeter and I have made some \n \ncalculations. Of course, we cannot know \nprecisely what life would be like in such a \nplace, but we wanted to see if, within the \nlaws of physics and chemistry, a world of this \nsort could possibly be inhabited.  \nOne way to make a living under these \nconditions is to reproduce before you are \nfried and hope that convection will carry   \nOne Voice in the Cosmic Fugue  \u2014 41 \nsome of your offspring to the higher and cooler layers of the  \natmosphere. Such organisms could he very little. We call them sinkers. \nBut you could also be a floater, some vast hydrogen balloon pumping \nhelium and heavier gases out of its interior and leaving only the \nlightest gas, hydrogen; or a hot -air balloon, stayi ng buoyant by keeping \nyour interior warm, using energy acquired from the food you eat. Like \nfamiliar terrestrial balloons, the deeper a floater is carried, the stronger \nis the buoyant force returning it to the higher, cooler, safer regions of \nthe atmospher e. A floater might eat preformed organic molecules, or \nmake its own from sunlight and air, somewhat as plants do on Earth. \nUp to a point, the bigger a floater is, the more efficient it will be. \nSalpeter and I imagined floaters kilometers across, enormously  larger \nthan the greatest whale that ever was, beings the size of cities.  \nThe floaters may propel themselves through the planetary \natmosphere with gusts of gas, like a ramjet or a rocket. We imagine \nthem arranged in great lazy herds for as far as the eye can see, with \npatterns on their skin, an adaptive camouflage implying that they have \nproblems, too. Because there is at least one other ecological niche in \nsuch an environment; hunting. Hunters are fast and maneuverable. \nThey eat the floaters both for their organic molecules and for their \nstore of pure hydrogen. Hollow sinkers co uld have evolved into the \nfirst floaters, and self - propelled floaters into the first hunters. There \ncannot be very many hunters, because if they consume all the floaters, \nthe hunters themselves will perish.  \nPhysics and chemistry permit such lifeforms. Art endows them with \na certain charm. Nature, however, is not obliged to follow our \nspeculations. But if there are billions of inhabited worlds in the Milky \nWay Galaxy, perhaps there will be a few  \npopulated by the sinkers, floaters and hunters which our \nimaginations, tempered by the laws of physics and chemistry, have \ngenerated.  \nBiology is more like history than it is like physics. You have to know \nthe past to understand the present. And you have to know it in \nexquisite detail. There is as yet no predictive theory of biology, just as \nthere is not yet a predictive theory of history . The reasons are the same: \nboth subjects are still too complicated for us. But we can know \nourselves better by understanding other cases. The study of a single \ninstance of extraterrestrial life, no matter how humble, will \ndeprovincialize biology. For the first time, the biologists will know \nwhat other kinds of life are possible. When we say the search for life \nelsewhere is important, we are not guaranteeing that it will be easy to \nfind\u2014only that it is very much worth seeking.  \n \nWe have heard so far the voice of life on one small world only.

And the seven planets oppress all \ncreation and deliver it over to death and all manner of evil: for the twelve signs of \nthe Zodiac and the seven planets rule  \nthe fate of the world.  \n\u2014The late Zoroastrian book, the Menok i Xrat  \nTo tell us that every species of thing is endowed with an occult specific quality by \nwhich it acts and produces manifest effects, is to tell us nothing; but to derive two \nor three general principles of motion from phenomena, and afterwards to tell us \nhow t he properties and actions of all corporeal things follow from those manifest \nprinciples, would be a very great step.  \n\u2014Isaac Newton, Optics  \nWe do not ask for what useful purpose the birds do sing, for song is their pleasure \nsince they were created for singing.

The above \nanimated and photographed by Judy \nKreijanovsky (C artoon Kitchen).  IF WE LIVED ON A PLANET WHERE NOTHING EVER CHANGED , \nthere would be little to do. There would be nothing to figure out. \nThere would be no impetus for science. And if we lived in an \nunpredictable world, where things changed in random or very \ncomplex ways, we would not be able to figure things out. Again, ther e \nwould be no such thing as science. But we live in an in -between \nuniverse, where things change, but according to patterns, rules, or, as \nwe call them, laws of nature. If I throw a stick up in the air, it  always \nfalls down. If the sun sets in the west, it always rises again the next \nmorning in the east. And so it becomes possible to figure things out. \nWe can do science, and with it we can improve our lives.  \nHuman beings are good at understanding the world. We always \nhave been. We were able to hunt game or build fires only because we \nhad figured something out. There was a time before television, before \nmotion pictures, before radio, before books. The greatest part of \nhuman existence was spent in such a time. Over the dying embers of \nthe campfire, on a moonless night, we watched the stars.  \nThe night sky is interesting. There are patterns there. Without even \ntrying, you can imagine pictures. In the northern sky, for example, \nthere is a pattern, or constellation, that looks a little ursine. Some \ncultures call it the Great Bear. Others see quit e different images. These \npictures are not, of course, really in the night sky; we put them there \nourselves. We were hunter folk, and we saw hunters and dogs, bears \nand young women, all manner of things of interest to us. When \nseventeenth -century European sailors first saw the southern skies they \nput objects of seventeenth -century interest in the heavens \u2014toucans \nand peacocks, telescopes and microscopes, compasses and the sterns \nof ships. If the constellations had been named in the twentieth \ncentury, I suppo se we would see bicycles and refrigerators in the sky, \nrock-and-roll \u201cstars\u201d and perhaps even mushroom clouds \u2014a new set of \nhuman hopes and fears placed among the stars.  \nOccasionally our ancestors would see a very bright star with a tail, \nglimpsed for just a moment, hurtling across the sky. They called it a \nfalling star, but it is not a good name: the old stars are still there after \nthe falling star falls. In some seasons there are many falling stars; in \nothers very few. There is a kind of regularity here as well.  \nLike the Sun and the Moon, stars always rise in the east and set in \nthe west, taking the whole night to cross the sky if they pass overhead. \nThere are different constellations in different seasons. The same \nconstellations always rise at the beginning of au tumn, say. It never \nhappens that a new constellation suddenly rises out of the east. There \nis an order, a predictability, a permanence about the stars. In a way, \nthey are almost comforting.  \nCertain stars rise just before or set just after the Sun \u2014and at times \nand positions that vary with the seasons. If you made  \n \nThe Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 47 \ncareful observations of the stars and recorded them over many  \nyears, you could predict the seasons. You could also measure the time \nof year by noting where on the horizon the Sun rose each day. In the \nskies was a great calendar, available to anyone with dedication and \nability and the means to keep records.  \nOur ancestors built devices to measure the passing of the seasons. \nIn Chaco Canyon, in New Mexico, there is a great roofless ceremonial \nkiva or temple, dating from the eleventh century. On June 21, the \nlongest day of the year, a shaft of sunlight enters a window at dawn \nand slowly moves so that it covers a special niche. But this happens \nonly around June 21. I imagine the proud Anasazi people, who \ndescribed themselves as \u201cThe Ancient Ones,\u201d gathered in their pews \nevery June 21, dressed in feathers and rattl es and turquoise to celebrate \nthe power of the Sun. They also monitored the apparent motion of \nthe Moon: the twenty -eight higher niches in the kiva may represent \nthe number of days for the Moon to return to the same position \namong the constellations. These  people paid close attention to the Sun \nand the Moon and the stars. Other devices based on similar ideas are \nfound at Angkor Wat in Cambodia; Stonehenge in England; Abu \nSimbel in Egypt; Chichen Itza in Mexico; and the Great Plains in \nNorth America.  \nSome alleged calendrical devices may just possibly be due to \nchance \u2014an accidental alignment of window and niche on June 21, say. \nBut there are other devices wonderfully different. At one locale in the \nAmerican Southwest is a set of three upright slabs whic h were moved \nfrom their original position about 1,000 years ago. A spiral a little like \na galaxy has been carved in the rock. On June 21, the first day of \nsummer, a dagger of sunlight pouring through an opening between \nthe slabs bisects the spiral; and on December 21, the first day of winter, \nthere are two daggers of sunlight that flank the spiral, a unique \napplication of the midday  \nsun to read the calendar in the sky.  \nWhy did people all over the world make such an effort to learn \nastronomy? We hunted gazelles and antelope and buffalo whose \nmigrations ebbed and flowed with the seasons. Fruits and nuts were \nready to be picked in some times but not in others. When we inven ted \nagriculture, we had to take care to plant and harvest our crops in the \nright season. Annual meetings of far - flung nomadic tribes were set for \nprescribed times. The ability to read the calendar in the skies was \nliterally a matter of life and death. The  reappearance of the crescent \nmoon after the new moon; the return of the Sun after a total eclipse; \nthe rising of the Sun in the morning after its troublesome absence at \nnight were noted by people around the world: these phenomena spoke to our ancestors of the possibility of \nsurviving death. Up there in the skies was \nalso a metaphor of immortality.  \nThe wind whips through the canyons \nin the American Southwest, and there is \nno one to hear it but us \u2014a reminder of \nthe  \nIn medieval Europe, the same stars were \nseen as Charles\u2019 Wain, or Wagon.  \n \nThe ancient Greeks and Native Americans \nsaw these stars as the tail of The Great \nBear\u2014Ursa Major.  \n \n \nThis larger group of stars, containing The  \nBig Dipper, was portrayed by the ancient Egyptians as a curious procession \nof a bull, a horizontal man or god, and a hippopotamus with a crocodile \non its back.

The more \naccurately you knew the position and movements of the Sun and \nMoon and stars, the more reliably you could predict when to hunt, \nwhen to sow and reap, when to gather the tribes. As precision of \nmeasurement improved, records had to be kept, so astronomy \nencouraged observation and mathematics and the development of \nwriting.  \nBut then, much later, another rather curious idea arose, an assault \nby mysticism and superstition into what had been largely an empirical \nscience. The Sun and stars controlled the seasons,  \n \nCasa Rincanada, an Anasazi temple with a \nnear perfect east -west alignment.  \n \nInterior of Casa Rincanada, showing six \nhigher and two lower niches.  \nfood, warmth. The Moon controlled the \ntides, the life cycles of many animals, and \nperhaps the human menstrual* period \u2014\nof central importance for a passionate \nspecies devoted to having children. \nThere was another kind ot object in the sky, the wandering or vagabond stars called planets. Our nomadic \nancestors must have felt an affinity for the planets. Not counting the \nSun and the Moon, you could see only five of them. They moved \nagainst the background of more distant stars. If you follo wed their \napparent moti on over many months, they would leave one \nconstellation, enter another, occasionally even do a kind of slow loop -\nthe-loop in the sky. Everything else in the sky had some real effect on \nhuman life. What must the influence of the planets be?  \nIn contemporary Western society, buying a magazine on astrology \u2014\nat a newsstand, say \u2014is easy; it is much harder to find one on \nastronomy. Virtually every newspaper in America has a daily column \non astrology; there are hardly any that have even a weekly colu mn on \nastronomy. There are ten times more astrolo-  \ngers in the United States than astronomers. At parties, when I meet \npeople who do not know I am a scientist, I am sometimes asked, \u201cAre \nyou a Gemini?\u201d (chances of success, one in twelve), or \u201cWhat sign are \nyou?\u201d Much more rarely am I asked, \u201cHave you heard  that gold is made \nin supernova explosions?\u201d or \u201cWhen do you think Congress will \napprove a Mars Rover?\u201d  \nAstrology contends that which constellation the planets are in at \nthe moment of your birth profoundly influences your future. A few \nthousand years ago, the idea developed that the motions of the planets \ndetermined the fates of kings, dynasties, empires. As trologers studied \nthe motions of the planets and asked themselves what had happened \nthe last time that, say, Venus was rising in the Constellation of the \nGoat; perhaps something similar would happen this time as well. It \nwas a subtle and risky business. As trologers came to be employed only \nby the State. In many countries it was a capital offense for anyone but \nthe official   \n \n \n* The root of the word means \u201cMoon.\u201d   \nThe Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 49 \nastrologer to read the portents in the skies: a good way to over-  \nthrow a regime was to predict its downfall. Chinese court astrologers \nwho made inaccurate predictions were executed. Others simply \ndoctored the records so that afterwards they were in perfect \nconformity with events. Astrology developed into a strange \ncombi nation of observations, mathematics and careful record -keeping \nwith fuzzy thinking and pious fraud.  \nBut if the planets could determine the destinies of nations, how \ncould they avoid influencing what will happen to me tomorrow? The \nnotion of a personal astrology developed in Alexandrian Egypt and \nspread through the Greek and Roman worlds about 2,000 years  ago. \nWe today can recognize the antiquity of astrology in words such as \ndisaster , which is Greek for \u201cbad star,\u201d influenza , Italian for (astral) \n\u201cinfluence\u201d; mazeltov , Hebrew \u2014and, ultimately, Babylonian \u2014for \u201cgood \nconstellation,\u201d or the Yiddish word shlama zel, applied to someone \nplagued by relentless ill -for- tune, which again traces to the Babylonian \nastronomical lexicon. According to Pliny, there were Romans \nconsidered sideratio , \u201cplanet -struck.\u201d Planets were widely thought to he \na direct cause of death. Or consider consider : it means \u201cwith the \nplanets,\u201d evidently a prerequisite for serious reflection. The table on \np. 51 shows the mortality statistics in the City of London in 1632. \nAmong the terrible losses from infant and childhood diseases and \nsuch exoti c illnesses as \u201cthe rising of the lights\u201d and \u201cthe King\u2019s evil,\u201d \nwe find that, of 9,535 deaths, 13 people succumbed to \u201cplanet,\u201d more \nthan died of cancer. 1 wonder what the symptoms were.  \nAnd personal astrology is with us still: consider two different \nnewspaper astrology columns published in the same city on the same \nday. For example, we can examine the New York Post and the New \nYork Daily News  on September 21, 1979. Suppose you are a Libra \u2014\nthat is, born between September 21 and October 22. According to the \nastrologer for the Post, \u201ca compromise will help ease tension\u201d; useful, \nperhaps, but somewhat vague. According to the Daily News \u2019s \nastrologer, you must \u201cdemand more of yourself,\u201d an admon ition that \nis also vague but also different. These \u201cpredictions\u201d are not \npredictions; rather they are pieces of advice \u2014they tell what to do, not \nwhat will happen. Deliberately, they are phrased so generally that they \ncould apply to anyone. And they display  major mutual \ninconsistencies. Why are they published as unapologetically as sports \nstatistics and stock market reports?  \nAstrology can be tested by the lives of twins. There are many cases \nin which one twin is killed in childhood, in a riding accident, say, or \nis struck by lightning, while the other lives to a prosperous old age. \nEach was born in precisely the same place and  within minutes of the other. Exactly the same planets were \nrising at their births. It astrology were \nvalid, how could two such twins have \nsuch profoundly different fates? It also \nturns out that  \nSunlight enters a window and illuminates a \nniche near dawn on June 21 at Casa Rincanada.  \n \nA striking Anasazi solstice marker from around \nthe year l000.  \n \n \n\u201cMedicine Wheel\u201d from Saskatchewan, built around 600 B.C.: the oldest \nastronomical observatory in the Americas.

In careful tests, they are unable to \npredict the character and future of people \nthey know nothing about except their time \nand place of birth.*  \nThere is something curious about the \nnational flags of the planet Earth. The flag \nof the United States has fifty stars; the \nSoviet Union and Israel, one each; Burma, \nfourteen; Grenada and Venezuela, seven; \nChina, five; Iraq, three; S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e \nPr\u00edncipe, two ; Japan, Uruguay, Malawi, \nBangladesh and Taiwan, the Sun; Brazil, a \ncelestial sphere; Australia, Western Samoa, \nNew Zealand and Papua New Guinea, the \nconstellation of the Southern Cross; Bhutan, the dragon pearl, symbol of the Earth; Cambodia, the Angkor \nWat astronomical observatory; India, South Korea and the Mongolian \nPeoples\u2019 Republic, cosmological syrribols. Many socialist nations \ndisplay stars. Many Islamic countries display crescent moons. Almost \nhalf of our national flags exhibit astronomical symbols . The \nphenomenon is transcultural, nonsectarian, worldwide. It is also not \nrestricted to our time: Sumerian cylinder seals from the third \nmillennium B.C. and Taoist flags in prerevolutionary China displayed \nconstellations. Nations, I do not doubt, wish to embrace something of \nthe power and credibility of the heavens. We seek a connection with \nthe Cosmos. We want to count in the grand scale of things. And it \nturns out we are connected \u2014not in the personal, small -scale \nunimaginative fashion that the astrologers pretend, but in the deepest \nways, involving the origin of matter, the habitability of the Earth, the \nevolution and destiny of the human species, themes to which we will \nreturn.  \nModern popular astrology runs directly back to Claudius Pto - \nlemaeus, whom we call Ptolemy, although he was unrelated to the \nkings of the same name. He worked in the Library of Alexandria in the \nsecond century. All that arcane business about planets ascend ant in \nthis or that solar or lunar \u201chouse\u201d or the \u201cAge of Aquarius\u201d comes \nfrom Ptolemy, who codified the Babylonian  \n \n*Skepticism about astrology and related doctrines is neither new nor exclusive \nto the West. For example, in the Essays on Idleness,  written in 1332 by Yoshida \nKenko, we read:  \nThe Yin -Yang teachings [in Japan] have nothing to say on the subject \nof the Red Tongue Days. Formerly people did not avoid these days, but \nof late \u2014I wonder who is responsible for starting this custom \u2014people \nhave taken to saying things such as, \u201cAn enterpri se begun on a Red \nTongue Day will never see an end,\u201d or, \u201cAnything you say or do on a \nRed Tongue Day is bound to come to naught: you lose what you\u2019ve \nwon, your plans are undone.\u201d What nonsense! If one counted the \nprojects begun on carefully selected \u201clucky  days\u201d which came to nothing \nin the end, they would probably be quite as many as the fruitless \nenterprises begun on the Red Tongue days.  \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 103 \nastrological tradition. Here is a typical horoscope from Ptolemy\u2019s time, \nwritten in Greek on papyrus, for a little girl born in the year 150: \u201cThe \nbirth of Philoe. The 10th year of Antoninus Caesar the lord, \nPhamenoth 15 to 16, first hour of the night. Sun  in Pisces, Jupiter and \nMercury in Aries, Saturn in Cancer, Mars in Leo, Venus and the \nMoon in Aquarius, horoscopus Capricorn.\u201d The method of \nenumerating the months and the years has changed much more over \nthe intervening centuries than have the astrologic al niceties. A typical \nexcerpt from Ptolemy\u2019s astrological book, the Tetrabiblos , reads: \n\u201cSaturn, if he is in the orient, makes his subjects in appearance dark -\nskinned, robust, black -haired, curly -haired, hairy -chested, with eyes of \nmoderate size, of middling stature, and in temperament having an \nexcess of the moist and cold.\u201d Ptolemy  believed not only that behavior \npatterns were influenced by the planets and the stars but also that \nquestions of stature, complexion, national character and even \ncongenital ph ysical abnormalities were determined by the stars. On \nthis point modern astrologers seem to have adopted a more cautious \nposition.  \nBut modern astrologers have forgotten about the precession of the \nequinoxes, which Ptolemy understood. They ignore atmospheric \nrefraction, about which Ptolemy wrote. They pay almost no attention \nto all the moons and planets, asteroids and comets, quasars a nd \npulsars, exploding galaxies, symbiotic stars, cataclysmic variables and \nX-ray sources that have been discovered since Ptolemy\u2019s time. \nAstronomy is a science \u2014the study of the universe as it is. Astrology is \na pseudoscience \u2014a claim, in the absence of good  evidence, that the \nother planets affect our everyday lives. In Ptolemy\u2019s time the \ndistinction between astronomy and astrology was not clear. Today it \nis. \nAs an astronomer, Ptolemy named the stars, listed their \nbrightnesses, gave good reasons for believing that the Earth is a sphere, \nset down rules for predicting eclipses and, perhaps most important, \ntried to understand why planets exhibit that strange, wand ering \nmotion against the background of distant constellations. He \ndeveloped a predictive model to understand planetary motions and \ndecode the message in the skies. The study of the heavens brought \nPtolemy a kind of ecstasy. \u201cMortal as I am,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI k now that I \nam born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried \nmultitude of the stars in their  \ncircular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth ...\u201d  \nPtolemy believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe; \nthat the Sun, Moon, planets and stars went around the Earth. This is \nthe most natural idea in the world. The Earth seems steady, solid, \nimmobile, while we can see the heavenly bodies rising  and setting each \nday. Every culture has leaped to the geocentric hypothesis. As Johannes Kepler wrote, \u201cIt is therefore \nimpossible that reason not previously \ninstructed should imagine anything \nother than that the Earth is a kind of vast \nhouse with  \n \nThe cover of John Graunt\u2019s 1632 book on \nactuarial statistics.  \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 104 \n \nCauses of death in London, 1632.

(One of the epithets given \nMars by the ancient Egyptians was sekded -\nef em khetkhet,  which means \u201cwho travels \nbackwards,\u201d a clear reference to its retrograde or loop -the-loop apparent motion.)  \nPtolemy\u2019s model of planetary motion can be represented by a little \nmachine, like those that, serving a similar purpose, existed in \nPtolemy\u2019s time.* The problem was to figure out a \u201creal\u201d motion of the \nplanets, as seen from up there, on the \u201coutside,\u201d which  would \nreproduce with great accuracy the apparent motion of the  \nplanets, as seen from down here, on the \u201cinside.\u201d  \nThe planets were imagined to go around the Earth affixed to perfect \ntransparent spheres. But they were not attached directly to the \nspheres, but indirectly, through a kind of off -center wheel. The sphere \nturns, the little wheel rotates, and, as seen from t he  \n \n* Four centuries earlier, such a device was constructed by Archimedes and \nexamined and described by Cicero in Rome, where it had been carried by the \nRoman general Marcellus, one of whose soldiers had, gratuitously and against \norders, killed the septuagenar ian scientist during the conquest of Syracuse.  \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 106 \nEarth, Mars does its loop -the-loop. This model permitted reasonably \naccurate predictions of planetary motion, certainly good enough for \nthe precision of measurement available in Ptolemy\u2019s day, and even \nmany centuries later.  \nPtolemy\u2019s aetherial spheres, imagined in medieval times to be made \nof crystal, are why we still talk about the music of the spheres and a \nseventh heaven (there was a \u201cheaven,\u201d or sphere for the Moon, \nMercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, and o ne more for \nthe stars). With the Earth the center of the Universe, with creation \npivoted about terrestrial events, with the heavens imagined \nconstructed on utterly unearthly principles, there was little motivation \nfor astronomical observations. Supported b y the Church through the \nDark Ages, Ptolemy\u2019s model helped prevent the advance of astronomy \nfor a millennium. Finally, in 1543, a quite different hypothesis to \nexplain the apparent motion of the planets was published by a Polish \nCatholic cleric named Nicho las Copernicus. Its most daring feature \nwas the proposition that the Sun, not the Earth, was at the center of \nthe universe. The Earth was demoted to just one of the planets, third \nfrom the Sun, moving in a perfect circular orbit. (Ptolemy had \nconsidered su ch a heliocentric model but rejected it immediately; \nfrom the physics of Aristotle, the implied violent rotation of the Earth \nseemed contrary to observation.)  \nIt worked at least as well as Ptolemy\u2019s spheres in explaining the \napparent motion of the planets. But it annoyed many people. In 1616 \nthe Catholic Church placed Copernicus\u2019 work on its list of forbidden \nbooks \u201cuntil corrected\u201d by local ecclesiastical censo rs, where it \nremained until 1835.* Martin Luther described him as \u201can upstart \nastrologer . . . This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of \nastronomy. But Sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the \nSun to stand still, and not the Earth.\u201d Even  some of Copernicus\u2019 \nadmirers argued that he had not really believed in a Sun -centered \nuniverse but had merely proposed it as a convenience for calculating \nthe motions of the planets.  \nThe epochal confrontation between the two views of the  \nCosmos \u2014Earth -centered and Sun -centered \u2014reached a climax in the \nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the person of a man who was, \nlike Ptolemy, both astrologer and astronomer. He lived in a time when \nthe human spirit was fettered and the mind chained; whe n the \necclesiastical pronouncements of a millennium or two earlier on \nscientific matters were considered more reliable than contemporary \nfindings made with techniques unavailable to the ancients; when \ndeviations, even on arcane theological matters, from th e prevailing \ndoxological preferences, Catholic or  \n \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 107 \n* In a recent inventory of nearly every sixteenth -century copy of \nCopernicus\u2019 book, Owen Gingerich has found the censorship to have \nbeen ineffective: only 60 percent of the copies in Italy were \u201ccorrected,\u201d \nand not one in Iberia.   \n54 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nCalendar page for November, showing Sagittarius the  A medieval discussion of the relative lengths of \nthe Archer.

The \nheavens were inhabited by angels, demons \nand the Hand of God, turning the \nplanetary crystal spheres. Science was \nbarren of the idea that underlying the \nphenomena of Nature mig ht be the laws of \nphysics. But the brave and lonely struggle of \nthis man was to ignite the modern scientific \nrevolution.  Johannes Kepler was born in Germany in 1571 and sent as a boy to \nthe Protestant seminary school in the provincial town of Maulbronn \nto be educated for the clergy. It was a kind of boot camp, training \nyoung minds in the use of theological weaponry against t he fortress of \nRoman Catholicism. Kepler, stubborn, intelligent and fiercely \nindependent, suffered two friendless years in bleak Maulbronn, \nbecoming isolated and withdrawn, his thoughts devoted to his \nimagined unworthiness in the eyes of God. He repented a  thousand \nsins no more wicked than another\u2019s and despaired of ever attaining \nsalvation.  \nBut God became for him more than a divine wrath craving \npropitiation. Kepler\u2019s God was the creative power of the Cosmos. The \nboy\u2019s curiosity conquered his fear. He wished to learn the eschatology \nof the world; he dared to contemplate the Mind of God. These  \ndangerous visions, at first insubstantial as a memory, became a lifelong \nobsession. The hubristic longings of a child seminarian were to carry \nEurope out of the cloister of medieval thought.  \nThe sciences of classical antiquity had been silenced more than a \nthousand years before, but in the late Middle Ages some faint echoes \nof those voices, preserved by Arab scholars, began to insinuate \nthemselves into the European educational curriculum. In M aulbronn, \nKepler heard their reverberations, studying, besides theology, Greek \nand Latin, music and mathematics. In the geometry of Euclid he \nthought he glimpsed an image of perfection and cosmic glory. He was \nlater to write: \u201cGeometry existed before the C reation. It is co -eternal \nwith the mind of God . . . Geometry provided God with a model for \nthe Creation . . . Geometry is God Himself.\u201d  \nIn the midst of Kepler\u2019s mathematical raptures, and despite his \nsequestered life, the imperfections of the outside world must also have \nmolded his character. Superstition was a widely available nostrum for \npeople powerless against the miseries of famine, p estilence and deadly \ndoctrinal conflict. For many, the only certainty was the stars, and the \nancient astrological conceit prospered in the courtyards and taverns of \nfear-haunted Europe. Kepler, whose attitude toward astrology \nremained ambiguous all his lif e, wondered whether there might be \nhidden patterns un-  \nderlying the apparent chaos of daily life. If the world was crafted by \nGod, should it not be examined closely? Was not all of creation an \nexpression of the harmonies in the mind of God? The book of Nature \nhad waited more than a millennium for a reader.  \nIn 1589, Kepler left Maulbronn to study for the clergy at the  \n \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 57 \ngreat university in T\u00fcbingen and found it a liberation. Confronted by the \nmost vital intellectual currents of the time, his  \ngenius was immediately recognized by his teachers \u2014one of whom \nintroduced the young man to the dangerous mysteries of the \nCopernican hypothesis. A heliocentric universe resonated with \nKepler\u2019s religious sense, and he embraced it with fervor. The Sun was \na metaphor for God, around Whom all else revolves. Before he was to \nbe ordained, he was made an attractive offer of secular employment, \nwhich \u2014perhaps because he felt himself indifferently suited to an \necclesiastical career \u2014he found himself accepting. He was s ummoned \nto Graz, in Austria, to teach secondary school mathematics, and began \na little later to prepare astronomical and meteorological almanacs and \nto cast horoscopes. \u201cGod provides for every animal his means of \nsustenance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the astronomer,  He has provided \nastrology.\u201d  \nKepler was a brilliant thinker and a lucid writer, but he was a \ndisaster as a classroom teacher. He mumbled. He digressed. He was at \ntimes utterly incomprehensible. He drew only a handful of students \nhis first year at Graz; the next year there were none. H e was distracted \nby an incessant interior clamor of associations and speculations vying \nfor his attention. And one pleasant summer afternoon, deep in the \ninterstices of one of his interminable lectures, he was visited by a \nrevelation that was to alter radi cally the future of astronomy. Perhaps \nhe stopped in mid -sentence. His inattentive students, longing for the \nend of the day, took little  \nnotice, I suspect, of the historic moment.  \nThere were only six planets known in Kepler\u2019s time: Mercury, \nVenus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Kepler wondered why only \nsix? Why not twenty, or a hundred? Why did they have the spacing \nbetween their orbits that Copernicus had deduced? No one had ever  \nasked such questions before. There were known to be five regular or \n\u201cplatonic\u201d solids, whose sides were regular polygons, as known to the \nancient Greek mathematicians after the time of Pythagoras. Kepler \nthought the two numbers were connected, that the reason there were \nonly six planets was because there were only five regular solids, and \nthat these solids, inscribed or nested one within another, would \nspecify the distances of the planets from the Sun. In these perfect \nforms, he  \nbelieved he had recognized the invisible supporting structures for the \nspheres of the six planets. He called his revelation The Cosmic \nMystery. The connection between the solids of Pythagoras and the  \ndisposition of the planets could admit but one explanation: the Hand \nof God, Geometer.  \nKepler was amazed that he \u2014immersed, so he thought, in sin \u2014 should have \nbeen divinely chosen to make this great discovery.  \nHe submitted a proposal for a research grant to the Duke of \nW\u00fcrttemberg, offering to supervise the construction of his nested \nsolids as a three -dimensional model so that others could glimpse   \n58 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe five perfect solids of Pythagoras and \nPlato. See Appendix 2.  the beauty of the holy geometry. It might, he added, be contrived of \nsilver and precious stones and serve incidentally as a ducal chalice. \nThe proposal was rejected with the kindly advice that he first construct \na less expensive version out of paper, which  he promptly attempted to \ndo: \u201cThe intense pleasure I have re - \nceived from this discovery can never be told in words . . . I shunned \nno calculation no matter how difficult. Days and nights I spent in \nmathematical labors, until I could see whether my hypothesis would \nagree with the orbits of Copernicus or whether my jo y was to vanish \ninto thin air.\u201d But no matter how hard he tried, the solids and the \nplanetary orbits did not agree well. The elegance and grandeur of the \ntheory, however, persuaded him that the observations must be in \nerror, a conclusion drawn when  \nKepler\u2019s Cosmic Mystery, the spheres of the \nsix planets nested in the five perfect solids of \nPythagoras and Plato. The outermost perfect \nsolid is the cube.  \nthe observations are unobliging by many other theorists in the history \nof science. There was then only one man in the world who had access \nto more accurate observations of apparent plan-  \netary positions, a self -exiled Danish nobleman who had accepted the \npost of Imperial Mathematician in the Court of the Holy Roman \nEmperor, Rudolf II. That man was Tycho Brahe. By chance, at \n \nRudolf\u2019s suggestion, he had just invited Kepler, whose mathematical \nfame was growing, to join him in Prague.  \nA provincial schoolteacher of humble origins, unknown to all but \na few mathematicians, Kepler was diffident about Tycho\u2019s offer. But \nthe decision was made for him. In 1598, one of the   \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 59 \nmany premonitory tremors of the coming Thirty Years\u2019 War engulfed \nhim. The local Catholic archduke, steadfast in dogmatic certainty, \nvowed he would rather \u201cmake a desert of the country than rule over \nheretics.\u201d* Protestants were excluded from economic and political \npower, Kepler\u2019s school was closed, and prayers, books and hymns \ndeemed heretical were forbidden. Finally the townspeople were \nsummoned to individual examina - \ntions on the soundness of their private religious convictions, those \nrefusing to profess the Roman Catholic faith being fined a tenth of \ntheir income and, upon pain of death, exiled forever from Graz. \nKepler chose exile: \u201cHypocrisy I have never learned. I am in earnest \nabout faith. 1 do not play with it.\u201d  \nLeaving Graz, Kepler, his wife and stepdaughter set out on the \ndifficult journey to Prague. Theirs was not a happy marriage. \nChronically ill, having recently lost two young children, his wife was \ndescribed as \u201cstupid, sulking, lonely, melancholy.\u201d She had no \nunderstanding of her husband\u2019s work and, having been raised among \nthe minor rural gentry, she despised his impecunious profession. He \nfor his part alternately admonished and ignored her, \u201cfor my studies \nsometimes made me thoughtless; but I learned my le sson, I learned to \nhave patience with her. When 1 saw that she took my words to heart, \nI would rather have bitten my own finger than to give her further \noffense.\u201d But Kepler  \nremained preoccupied with his work.  \nHe envisioned Tycho\u2019s domain as a refuge from the evils of the \ntime, as the place where his Cosmic Mystery would be confirmed. He \naspired to become a colleague of the great Tycho Brahe, who for thirty -\nfive years had devoted himself, before the invention of  the telescope, \nto the measurement of a clockwork universe, ordered and precise. \nKepler\u2019s expectations were to be unfulfilled. Tycho himself was a \nflamboyant figure, festooned with a golden nose, the original having \nbeen lost in a student duel fought over who was the superior \nmathematician. Around him was a raucous entourage of assistants, \nsycophants, distant relatives and assorted hangers -on. Their endless \nrevelry, their innuendoes and intrigues, their cruel mockery of the \npious and scholarly country bumpk in depressed and saddened Kepler: \n\u201cTycho . . . is superlatively rich but knows not how to make use of it. \nAny single instrument of his costs more than my and my whole \nfamily\u2019s fortunes put together.\u201d  \nImpatient to see Tycho\u2019s astronomical data, Kepler would be \nthrown only a few scraps at a time: \u201cTycho gave me no opportunity to \nshare in his experiences. He would only, in the course of a   \n \n* By no means the most extreme such remark in medieval or Reformation \nEurope. Upon being asked how to distinguish the faithful from the \ninfidel in the siege of a largely Albigensian city, Domingo de Guzman,  \nlater known as Saint Dominic, allegedly replied: \u201cKill them all. God will know \nhis own.\u201d  \n \nmeal and, in between other matters, mention, as if in passing, today \nthe figure of the apogee of one planet, tomorrow the nodes of another \n. . . Tycho possesses the best observations . . . He also has collaborators. \nHe lacks only the architect who would pu t all this to use.\u201d Tycho was \nthe greatest observational genius of the age, and Kepler the greatest \ntheoretician. Each knew that, alone, he would be unable to achieve \nthe synthesis of an accurate and coherent world system, which they \nboth felt to be immine nt. But Tycho was not about to make a gift of \nhis life\u2019s work to a much younger potential rival. Joint authorship of \nthe results, if any, of the collaboration was for some reason \nunacceptable. The birth of modern science \u2014the offspring of theory \nand observa tion\u2014teetered on the precipice of their mutual mistrust. \nIn the remaining eighteen months that Tycho was to live, the two \nquarreled and were reconciled repeatedly. At a dinner given by the \nBaron of Rosenberg, Tycho, having robustly drunk much wine, \n\u201cplaced  civility ahead of health,\u201d and resisted his body\u2019s urgings to \nleave, even if briefly, before the baron. The consequent urinary \ninfection worsened when Tycho resolutely rejected advice to temper \nhis eating and drinking. On his deathbed, Tycho bequeathed hi s  \nobservations to Kepler, and \u201con the last night of his gentle delirium, \nhe repeated over and over again these words, like someone \ncomposing a poem: \u2018Let me not seem to have lived in vain  \n. . . Let me not seem to have lived in vain.\u2019 \u201d  \nAfter Tycho\u2019s death, Kepler, now the new Imperial Mathematician, \nmanaged to extract the observations from Tycho\u2019s recalcitrant family. \nHis conjecture that the orbits of the planets are circumscribed by the \nfive platonic solids was no more supported by Tych o\u2019s data than by \nCopernicus\u2019. His \u201cCosmic Mystery\u201d was disproved entirely by the \nmuch later discoveries of the planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto \u2014\nthere are no additional platonic solids* that would determine their \ndistances from the sun. The nested Pythagor ean solids also made no \nallowance for the existence of the Earth\u2019s moon, and Galileo\u2019s \ndiscovery of the four large moons of Jupiter was also discomfiting. But \nfar from becoming morose, Kepler wished to find additional satellites \nand wondered how many satel lites each planet should have. He wrote \nto Galileo: \u201cI immediately began to think how there could  \nbe any addition to the number of the planets without overturning my \nMysterium Cosmographicum, according to which Euclid\u2019s five regular \nsolids do not allow more than six planets around the Sun ... I am so \nfar from disbelieving the existence of the four circ umjovial planets that \nI long for a telescope, to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering two \naround Mars, as the proportion seems to require, six or eight round \nSaturn, and perhaps one each round Mercury and Venus.\u201d Mars does \nhave two small moons, and a major geological feature on the larger of \nthem is today  \n \n* The proof of this statement can be found in Appendix 2.  \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 61 \n120 \u2014 Cosmos  \ncalled the Kepler Ridge in honor of this guess. But he was entirely \nmistaken about Saturn, Mercury and Venus, and Jupiter has many \nmore moons than Galileo discovered. We still do not really know why \nthere are only nine planets, more or less, and why they h ave the \nrelative distances from the Sun that they do. (See Chapter 8.)  \nTycho\u2019s observations of the apparent motion of Mars and other \nplanets through the constellations were made over a period of many \nyears. These data, from the last few decades before the telescope was \ninvented, were the most accurate that had yet been  \nobtained. Kepler worked with a passionate intensity to understand \nthem: What real motion of the Earth and Mars about the Sun could \nexplain, to the precision of measurement, the apparent motion of \nMars in the sky, including its retrograde loops through the \nbackground constellations? Tycho had commended Mars to Kepler \nbecause its apparent motion seemed most anomalous, most difficult \nto reconcile with an orbit made of circles. (To the reader who might \nbe bored by his many calculations, he later wrote: \u201cIf you are wearied \nby this tedious procedure, take pity on me who carried out at least \nseventy trials.\u201d)  \nPythagoras, in the sixth century B.C., Plato, Ptolemy and all the \nChristian astronomers before Kepler had assumed that the planets \nmoved in circular paths. The circle was thought to be a \u201cperfect\u201d \ngeometrical shape and the planets, placed high in the heavens, away \nfrom earthly \u201ccorruption,\u201d were also thought to be in some mystical \nsense \u201cperfect.\u201d Galileo, Tycho and Copernicus were all committed to \nuniform circular planetary motion, the latter asserting that \u201cthe mind \nshudders\u201d at the alternative, because \u201c it would be unworthy to \nsuppose such a thing in a Creation constituted in the best possible \nway.\u201d So at first Kepler tried to explain the observations by imagining \nthat the Earth and Mars moved in circular orbits about the Sun.  \nAfter three years of calculation, he believed he had found the \ncorrect values for a Martian circular orbit, which matched ten of \nTycho\u2019s observations within two minutes of arc. Now, there are 60 \nminutes of arc in an angular degree, and 90 degrees, a right angle, \nfrom the horizon to the zenith. So a few minutes of arc is a very small \nquantity to measure \u2014especially without a telescope. It is one -fifteenth \nthe angular diameter of the full Moon as seen from Earth. But Kepler\u2019s \nreplenishable ecstasy soon crumble d into gloom \u2014because two of \nTycho\u2019s further observations were inconsistent with Kepler\u2019s orbit, by \nas much as eight minutes of arc:  \nDivine Providence granted us such a diligent observer in Tycho \nBrahe that his observations convicted this . . . calculation of an \nerror of eight minutes; it is only right that we should accept \nGod\u2019s gift with a grateful mind . . . If I had believed that we  \ncould ignore these eight minutes, I would have patched up my \nhypothesis accordingly. But, since it  121 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nKepler\u2019s first law: A planet (P) moves in an \nellipse with the Sun (S) at one of the two foci.  \n \nKepler\u2019s second law: A planet sweeps out \nequal areas in equal times. It takes as long to \ntravel from B to A as from F to E as from D \nto C; and the shaded areas BSA, FSE and \nDSC are all equal.  \nwas not permissible to ignore, \nthose eight minutes pointed the \nroad to a complete reformation \nin astronomy.  \nThe difference between a circular \norbit and the true orbit could be \ndistinguished only by precise \nmeasurement and a courageous \nacceptance of the facts: \u201cThe universe is \nstamped with the adornment of \nharmonic proportions, but harmonies \nmust accommodate expe rience.\u201d Kepler \nwas shaken at being compelled to \nabandon a circular orbit and to question \nhis faith in the Divine Geometer. Having cleared the stable of astronomy of circles and spirals, he was left, he \nsaid, with \u201conly a single cartful of dung,\u201d a stretch ed-out circle \nsomething like an oval.  \nEventually, Kepler came to feel that his fascination with the circle \nhad been a delusion. The Earth was a planet, as Copernicus had said, \nand it was entirely obvious to Kepler that the Earth, wracked by wars, \npestilence, famine and unhappiness, fell short of perfection. Kepler \nwas one of the first people since antiquity to propose that the planets \nwere material objects made of imperfect stuff like the Earth. And if \nplanets were \u201cimperfect,\u201d why not their orbits as well? He tried various \noval-like curves, ca lculated away, made some arithmetical mistakes \n(which caused him at first to reject the correct answer) and months \nlater in some desperation tried the formula for an ellipse, first codified \nin the Alexandrian Library by Apollonius of Perga. He found that i t \nmatched Tycho\u2019s observations beautifully: \u201cThe truth of nature, which \nI had rejected and chased away, returned by stealth through the back \ndoor, disguising itself to be accepted . . . Ah, what a foolish bird I have \nbeen!\u201d  \nKepler had found that Mars moves about the Sun not in a circle, \nbut in an ellipse. The other planets have orbits much less elliptical \nthan that of Mars, and if Tycho had urged him to study the motion \nof, say, Venus, Kepler might never have discovered the t rue orbits of \nthe planets. In such an orbit the Sun is not at the center but is offset, \nat the focus of the ellipse. When a given planet is at its nearest to the \nSun, it speeds up. When it is at its farthest, it slows down. Such \nmotion is why we describe t he planets as forever falling toward, but \nnever reaching, the Sun. Kepler\u2019s first law of planetary motion is \nsimply this: A planet moves in an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.  \nIn uniform circular motion, an equal angle or fraction of the arc of \na circle is covered in equal times. So, for example, it takes twice as long \nto go two -thirds of the way around a circle as it does to go one -third of \nthe way around. Kepler found somethin g different for elliptical orbits: \nAs the planet moves along its orbit, it sweeps out a little wedge -shaped \narea within the ellipse. When it is close to the Sun, in a given period \nof time it traces out a large arc in its orbit, but the area represented by \nthat arc is not very large because the planet is then near the Sun. When \nthe planet is far from the Sun, it covers a much smaller arc in the same \nperiod  \nThe Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 122 \nof time, but that arc corresponds to a bigger area because the Sun is \nnow more distant. Kepler found that these two areas were precisely the \nsame no matter how elliptical the orbit: the long skinny area, \ncorresponding to the planet far from the Sun, and th e shorter, squatter \narea, when the planet is close to the Sun, are exactly equal. This was \nKepler\u2019s second law of planetary motion: Planets sweep out equal areas \nin equal times.  \nKepler\u2019s first two laws may seem a little remote and abstract: planets \nmove in ellipses, and sweep out equal areas in equal dmes. Well, so \nwhat? Circular motion is easier to grasp. We might have a tendency to \ndismiss these laws as mere mathemati - \ncal tinkering, something removed from everyday life. But these are the \nlaws our planet obeys as we ourselves, glued by gravity to the surface \nof the Earth, hurtle through interplanetary space. We move in accord \nwith laws of nature that Kepler first discove red. When we send \nspacecraft to the planets, when we observe double stars, when we \nexamine the motion of distant galaxies, we find that throughout the \nuniverse Kepler\u2019s laws are obeyed.  \nMany years later, Kepler came upon his third and last law of \nplanetary motion, a law that relates the motion of various planets to \none another, that lays out correctly the clockwork of the solar system. \nHe described it in a book called The Harmonies of the  World.  Kepler \nunderstood many things by the word harmony: the order and beauty \nof planetary motion, the existence of mathematical laws explaining \nthat motion \u2014an idea that goes back to Pythagoras \u2014and even harmony \nin the musical sense, the  \n\u201charmony of the spheres.\u201d Unlike the orbits of Mercury and Mars, \nthe orbits of the other planets depart so little from circularity that we \ncannot make out their true shapes even in an extremely accurate \ndiagram. The Earth is our moving platform from which we observe \nthe motion of the other planets against the backdrop of distant \nconstellations. The inner planets move  \nrapidly in their orbits \u2014that is why Mercury has the name it does: \nMercury was the messenger of the gods. Venus, Earth and Mars move \nprogressively less rapidly about the Sun. The outer planets, such as \nJupiter and Saturn, move stately and slow, as befits th e kings of the \ngods.  \nKepler\u2019s third or harmonic law states that the squares of the periods \nof the planets (the times for them to complete one orbit) are \nproportional to the cubes of their average distance from the Sun; the \nmore distant the planet, the more slowly it moves, but  according to a \nprecise mathematical law: P2 = a3 where P represents the period of \nrevolution of the planet about the Sun, measured in years, and a the \ndistance of the planet from the Sun measured in \u201castronomical units.\u201d An astronomical unit is the distan ce of \nthe Earth from the Sun. Jupiter, for \nexample, is five astronomical units from \nthe Sun, and a3 = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 125. What \nnumber times itself equals 125? Why, \n11, close enough. And 11 years is the \nperiod for Jupiter to go once around the \nSun.  \n \nKepler\u2019s third or harmonic law, a precise \nconnection between the size of a planet\u2019s \norbit and the period for it to go once \naround the Sun. It clearly applies to \nUranus, Neptune and Pluto, planets \ndiscovered long after Kepler\u2019s death.  \n123 \u2014 Cosmos  \nA similar argument applies for every planet and asteroid and comet.  \nNot content merely to have extracted from Nature the laws of \nplanetary motion, Kepler endeavored to find some still more \nfundamental underlying cause, some influence of the Sun on the \nkinematics of worlds. The planets sped up on approaching the Sun \nand slo wed down on retreating from it. Somehow the distant planets \nsensed the Sun\u2019s presence. Magnetism also was an influence felt at a \ndistance, and in a stunning anticipation of the idea of universal \ngravitation, Kepler suggested that the underlying cause was a kin to \nmagnetism:  \nMy aim in this is to show that the celestial machine is to be \nlikened not to a divine organism but rather to a clockwork . . . , \ninsofar as nearly all the manifold movements are carried out by \nmeans of a single, quite simple magnetic force, as in the case of \na clockwork [where] all motions [are caused]  \nby a simple weight.  \nMagnetism is, of course, not the same as gravity, but Kepler\u2019s \nfundamental innovation here is nothing short of breathtaking: he \nproposed that quantitative physical laws that apply to the Earth are \nalso the underpinnings of quantitative physical laws that  \ngovern the heavens. It was the first nonmystical explanation of motion \nin the heavens; it made the Earth a province of the Cosmos. \n\u201cAstronomy,\u201d he said \u201cis part of physics.\u201d Kepler stood at a cusp in \nhistory; the last scientific astrologer was the first as trophysicist.  \nNot given to quiet understatement, Kepler assessed his discoveries \nin these words:  \nWith this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity \nof time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the \ndelight of God, the Supreme Artist. . . . I yield  \nfreely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the \nbook \u2014to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can \nwait a century for a reader, as God Himself has waited 6,000 \nyears for a witness.  \nWithin the \u201csymphony of voices,\u201d Kepler believed that the speed of \neach planet corresponds to certain notes in the Latinate musical scale \npopular in his day \u2014do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. He claimed that in the \nharmony of the spheres, the tones of Earth are fa and mi, that the \nEarth is forever humming fa and mi, and that they stand in a \nstraightforward way for the Latin word for famine. He argued, not \nunsuccessfully, that the Earth was best  \ndescribed by that single doleful word.  124 \u2014 Cosmos  \nExactly eight days after Kepler\u2019s discovery of his third law, the \nincident that unleashed the Thirty Years\u2019 War transpired in Prague. \nThe war\u2019s convulsions shattered the lives of millions,  \nKepler among them. He lost his wife and son to an epidemic carried \nby the soldiery, his royal patron was deposed, and he was  The Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 125 \nexcommunicated by the Lutheran Church for his uncompromising \nindividualism on matters of doctrine. Kepler was a refugee once again. \nThe conflict, portrayed by both the Catholics and the Protestants as a \nholy war, was more an exploitation of reli-  \ngious fanaticism by those hungry for land and power. In the past, wars \nhad tended to be resolved when the belligerent princes had exhausted \ntheir resources. But now organized pillage was introduced as a means \nof keeping armies in the field. The savaged pop ulation of Europe stood \nhelpless as plowshares and pruning hooks were literally beaten into \nswords and spears.*  \nWaves of rumor and paranoia swept through the countryside, \nenveloping especially the powerless. Among the many scapegoats \nchosen were elderly women living alone, who were charged with \nwitchcraft: Kepler\u2019s mother was carried away in the middle of the night \nin a laundry chest. In Kepler\u2019s little hometown of Weil der Stadt, \nroughly three women were tortured and killed as witches every year \nbetween 1615 and 1629. And Katharina Kepler was a cantankerous \nold woman. She engaged in disputes that annoyed the local n obility, \nand she sold soporific and perhaps hallucinogenic drugs as do \ncontemporary Mexican curanderas.  Poor Kepler believed that he \nhimself had contributed to her arrest.  \nIt came about because Kepler wrote one of the first works of science \nfiction, intended to explain and popularize science. It was called the \nSomnium , \u201cThe Dream.\u201d He imagined a journey to the Moon, the \nspace travelers standing on the lunar surface and observing the lovely \nplanet Earth rotating slowly in the sky above them. By changing our \nperspective we can figure out how worlds work. In Kepler\u2019s time  one \nof the chief objections to the idea that the Earth turns was the fact that \npeople do not feel the motion . In the Somnium  he tried to make the \nrotation of the Earth plausible, dramatic, comprehensible: \u201cAs long as \nthe multitude does not err, . . . I want to be on the side of the many. \nTherefore, I take great pains to explain to as many people as possible.\u201d \n(On another occasi on he wrote in a letter, \u201cDo not sentence me \ncompletely to the treadmill of mathematical calculations \u2014leave me \ntime for philosophical speculations, my sole delight.\u201d2) \n \n2 Brahe, like Kepler, was far from hostile to astrology, although he carefully \ndistinguished his own secret version of astrology from the more common \nvariants of his time, which he thought conducive to superstition. In his \nbook Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica,  published in 1598, he argued that \nastrology is \u201creally more reliable than one would think\u201d if charts of the \nposition of the stars were properly improved. Brahe wrote: \u201cI have been \noccupied in alchemy, as much as by the celestial studies, from my 23rd \nyear.\u201d But both of these pseudosciences, he felt, had secrets far too \ndangerous for the general populace (although entirely safe, he thought, in The Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 126 \n \n* Some examples are still to be seen in the Graz armory.  \n \nthe hands of those princes and kings from whom he sought support). \nBrahe continued the long and truly dangerous  \n127 \u2014 Cosmos  \nThe Moon from the Earth: The view \nfrom just outside the atmosphere.  \nWith the invention of the telescope, what Kepler called \u201clunar \ngeography\u201d was becoming possible. In the Somnium, he described the \nMoon as filled with mountains and valleys and as \u201cporous, as though \ndug through with hollows and continuous caves,\u201d a referenc e to the \nlunar craters Galileo had recently discovered with the first \nastronomical telescope. He also imagined that the Moon had its \ninhabitants, well adapted to the inclemencies of the local environment. \nHe describes the slowly rotating Earth viewed from the lunar surface \nand imagines the continents and oceans of our planet to produce some \nassociative image like the Man in the Moon. He pictures the near \ncontact of southern Spain with  \nNorth Africa at the Straits of Gibraltar as a young woman in a flowing \ndress about to kiss her lover \u2014although rubbing noses looks more like \nit to me.  \nBecause of the length of the lunar day and night Kepler described \n\u201cthe great intemperateness of climate and the most violent alternation \nof extreme heat and cold on the Moon,\u201d which is entirely correct. Of \ncourse, he did not get everything right. He believ ed, for example, that \nthere was a substantial lunar atmosphere and oceans and inhabitants. \nMost curious is his view of the origin of the lunar craters, which make \nthe Moon, he says, \u201cnot dissimilar to the face of a boy disfigured with \nsmallpox.\u201d He argued  correctly that the craters are depressions rather \nthan mounds. From his own observations he noted the ramparts \nsurrounding many craters and the existence of central peaks. But he \nthought that their regular circular shape implied such a degree of order \nthat only intelligent life could explain them. He did not realize that \n128 \u2014 Cosmos  \ngreat rocks falling out of the sky would produce a local explosion, \nperfectly symmetric in all directions, that would carve out a circular \ncavity \u2014the origin of the bulk of the craters on the Moon and the other \nterrestrial planets. He deduced instead \u201cthe e xistence of some race \nrationally capable of constructing those hollows on the surface of the \nMoon. This race must have many individuals, so that one group puts \none hollow to use while another group constructs another hollow.\u201d \nAgainst the view that such gre at construction projects were unlikely, \nKepler offered as counterexamples the pyramids of Egypt and the \nGreat Wall of China, which can, in fact, be seen today from Earth \norbit. The idea that geometrical order reveals an underlying \nintelligence was central to Kepler\u2019s life. His argument on the lunar  \n \ntradition of some scientists who believe that only they and the temporal \nand ecclesiastical powers can be trusted with arcane knowledge: \u201cIt serves \nno useful purpose and is unreasonable, to make such things gen - \nerally known.\u201d Kepler, on the other hand, lectured on astronomy in \nschools, published extensively and often at his own expense, and wrote \nscience fiction, which was certainly not intended primarily for his \nscientific peers. He may not have been a popular w riter of science in the \nmodern sense, but the transition in attitudes in the single generation that \nseparated Tycho and Kepler is telling.  \nThe Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 129 \ncraters is a clear foreshadowing of the Martian canal controversy \n(Chapter 5). It is striking that the observational search for \nextraterrestrial life began in the same generation as the invention of \nthe telescope, and with the greatest theoretician of the age. \nParts of the Somnium  were clearly autobiographical. The hero, for \nexample, visits Tycho Brahe. He has parents who sell drugs. His \nmother consorts with spirits and daemons, one of whom eventually \nprovides the means to travel to the moon. The Somnium  makes clear \nto us, although it did not to all of Kepler\u2019s contemporaries, that \u201cin a \ndream one must be allowed the liberty of imagining occasionally that \nwhich never existed in the world of sense perception.\u201d Science fiction \nwas a new idea at the time of the Thir ty Years\u2019 War, and Kepler\u2019s book \nwas used as evidence that his mother was a witch.  \nIn the midst of other grave personal problems, Kepler rushed to \nW\u00fcrttemberg to find his seventy -four-year-old mother chained in a \nProtestant secular dungeon and threatened, like Galileo in a Catholic \ndungeon, with torture. He set about, as a scientist natu rally would, to \nfind natural explanations for the various events that had precipitated \nthe accusations of witchcraft, including minor physical ailments that \nthe burghers of W\u00fcrttemberg had attributed to her spells. The The Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 130 \nresearch was successful, a triumph, as was much of the rest of his life, \nof reason over superstition. His mother was exiled, with a sentence of  \ndeath passed on her should she ever return to W\u00fcrttemberg; and \nKepler\u2019s spirited defense apparently led to a decree by the Duke \nforbidding further trials for witchcraft on such slender evidence.  \nThe upheavals of the war deprived Kepler of much of his financial \nsupport, and the end of his life was spent fitfully, pleading for money \nand sponsors. He cast horoscopes for the Duke of Wallenstein, as he \nhad done for Rudolf II, and spent his final years in a Silesian town \ncontrolled by Wallenstein and called Sagan. His epitaph, which he \nhimself composed, was: \u201cI measured the skies, now the shadows I \nmeasure. Sky -bound was the mind, Earth -bound the body rests.\u201d But \nthe Thirty Years\u2019 War obliterated his gra ve. If a marker were to be \nerected today, it might read, in homage to his scientific courage: \u201cHe \npreferred the hard truth to his dearest illusions.\u201d  \nJohannes Kepler believed that there would one day be \u201ccelestial \nships with sails adapted to the winds of heaven\u201d navigating the sky, \nfilled with explorers \u201cwho would not fear the vastness\u201d of space. And \ntoday those explorers, human and robot, employ as une rring guides \non their voyages through the vastness of space the three laws of \nplanetary motion that Kepler uncovered during a lifetime of personal \ntravail and ecstatic discovery.  The Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 131 \nThe lifelong quest of Johannes Kepler, to understand the motions \nof the planets, to seek a harmony in the heavens, culmi-nated thirty -\nsix years after his death, in the work of  \nIsaac  The Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 132 \n \nThe Earth from the Moon: The view that \nKepler dreamed of.  \n133 \u2014 Cosmos  \nNewton. Newton was born on January 4, 1643, so tiny that, as his \nmother told him years later, he would have fit into a quart mug. Sickly, \nfeeling abandoned by his parents, quarrelsome, unsociable, a virgin to \nthe day he died, Isaac Newton was perhaps the g reatest scientific \ngenius who ever lived.  \nEven as a young man, Newton was impatient with insubstantial \nquestions, such as whether light was \u201ca substance or an accident,\u201d or \nhow gravitation could act over an intervening vacuum. He early \ndecided that the conventional Christian belief in the Trinity was a \nmisreading of Scripture. According to his biographer, John Maynard \nKeynes,  \nHe was rather a Judaic Monotheist of the school of Mai - \nmonides. He arrived at this conclusion, not on so -to-speak \nrational or sceptical grounds, but entirely on the interpretation \nof ancient authority. He was persuaded that the revealed \ndocuments gave no support to the Trinitarian  \ndoctrines which were due to late falsifications. The revealed God \nwas one God. But this was a dreadful secret which Newton was \nat desperate pains to conceal all his life.  \nLike Kepler, he was not immune to the superstitions of his day and \nhad many encounters with mysticism. Indeed, much of Newton\u2019s \nintellectual development can be attributed to this tension between \nrationalism and mysticism. At the Stourbridge Fair in 1663, a t age \ntwenty, he purchased a book on astrology, \u201cout of a curiosity to see \nwhat there was in it.\u201d He read it until he came to an illustration which \nhe could not understand, because he was ignorant of trigonometry. So \nhe purchased a book on trigonometry but  soon found himself unable \nto follow the geometrical arguments. So he found a copy of Euclid\u2019s \nElements of Geometry , and began to read. Two years later he invented \nthe differential calculus.  \nAs a student, Newton was fascinated by light and transfixed by the \nSun. He took to the dangerous practice of staring at the Sun\u2019s image \nin a looking glass:  \nIn a few hours I had brought my eyes to such a pass that I could \nlook upon no bright object with neither eye but I saw the Sun \nbefore me, so that I durst neither write nor read but to recover \nthe use of my eyes shut my self up in my chamber made dark \nthree  days together & used all means to divert my imagination \nfrom the Sun. For if I thought upon him I presently saw his \npicture though I was in the dark.  \nIn 1666, at the age of twenty -three, Newton was an undergraduate at \nCambridge University when an outbreak of plague forced him to 134 \u2014 Cosmos  \nspend a year in idleness in the isolated village of Woolsthorpe, where \nhe had been born. He occupied himself by inventing the differential \nand integral calculus, making fundamental discoveries on the nature \nof light and laying the foundation   \nThe Harmony of Worlds \u2014 69 \nfor the theory of universal gravitation. The only other year  \nlike it in the history of physics was Einstein\u2019s \u201cMiracle Year\u201d of 1905. \nWhen asked how he accomplished his astonishing discoveries, \nNewton replied unhelpfully, \u201cBy thinking upon them.\u201d His work was \nso significant that his teacher at Cambridge, Isaac Barro w, resigned \nhis chair of mathematics in favor of Newton five years after the young \nstudent returned to college.  \nNewton, in his mid -forties, was described by his servant as follows:  \nI never knew him to take any recreation or pastime either in \nriding out to take the air, walking, bowling, or any other exercise \nwhatever, thinking all hours lost that were not spent in his \nstudies, to which he kept so close that he seldom left his chamber  \nunless [to lecture] at term time . . . where so few went to hear \nhim, and fewer understood him, that ofttimes he did in a \nmanner, for want of hearers, read to the walls.  \nStudents both of Kepler and of Newton never knew what they were \nmissing.  \n \nNewton discovered the law of inertia, the tendency of a moving \nobject to continue moving in a straight line unless something \ninfluences it and moves it out of its path. The Moon, it seemed to \nNewton, would fly off in a straight line, tangential to its orbi t, unless \nthere were some other force constantly diverting the path into a near \ncircle, pulling it in the direction of the Earth. This force Newton called \ngravity, and believed that it acted at a distance. There is nothing \nphysically connecting the Earth and the Moon. And yet the Earth is \nconstantly pulling the Moon toward us. Using Kepler\u2019s third law, \nNewton mathematically deduced the nature of the gravitational \nforce.* He showed that the same force that pulls an apple down to \nEarth keeps the Moon in its orbit and accounts for the revolutions of \nthe then recently discovered moons of Jupiter in their orbits about \nthat distant planet.  \nThings had been falling down since the beginning of time. That the \nMoon went around the Earth had been believed for all of human \nhistory. Newton was the first person ever to figure out that these two \nphenomena were due to the same force. This is the meanin g of the \nword \u201cuniversal\u201d as applied to Newtonian gravitation. The same law \nof gravity applies everywhere in the universe.  \n \nIt is a law of the inverse square. The force declines inversely as the \nsquare of distance. If two objects are moved twice as far away, the \ngravity now pulling them together is only one -quarter  \n* Sadly, Newton does not acknowledge his debt to Kepler in his masterpiece \nthe Principia.  But in a 1686 letter to Edmund Halley, he says of his law of \ngravitation: \u201cI can affirm that I gathered it from Kepler\u2019s theorem about \ntwenty years ago.\u201d  \nIsaac Newton. Painting by Jean -Leon \nHuens, \u00a9 National Geographic Society.   \n70 \u2014 Cosmos  \nas strong. If they are moved ten times farther away, the gravity is ten \nsquared, 102 = 100 times smaller. Clearly, the force must in some sense \nbe inverse \u2014that is, declining with distance. If the force were direct, \nincreasing with distance, then the strongest force would work on the \nmost distant objects, and I suppose all the matter in th e universe \nwould find itself careering together into a single cosmic lump. No, \ngravity must decrease with distance, which is why a comet or a planet \nmoves slowly when far f rom the Sun and faster when close to the Sun \u2014\nthe gravity it feels is weaker the farther from the Sun it is.  \nAll three of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion can be derived from \nNewtonian principles. Kepler\u2019s laws were empirical, based upon the \npainstaking observations of Tycho Brahe. Newton\u2019s laws were \ntheoretical, rather simple mathematical abstractions from whic h all of \nTycho\u2019s measurements could ultimately be derived. From these laws, \nNewton wrote with undisguised pride in the Principia , \u201cI now \ndemonstrate the frame of the System of the World.\u201d  \nLater in his life, Newton presided over the Royal Society, a \nfellowship of scientists, and was Master of the Mint, where he devoted \nhis energies to the suppression of counterfeit coinage. His natural \nmoodiness and reclusivity grew; he resolved to abandon t hose \nscientific endeavors that brought him into quarrelsome disputes with \nother scientists, chiefly on issues of priority; and there were those who \nspread tales that he had experienced the seventeenth -century \nequivalent of a \u201cnervous breakdown.\u201d However, N ewton continued \nhis lifelong experiments on the border between alchemy and \nchemistry, and some recent evi-  \ndence suggests that what he was suffering from was not so much a \npsychogenic ailment as heavy metal poisoning, induced by systematic \ningestion of small quantities of arsenic and mercury. It was a common \npractice for chemists of the time to use the sense of  taste as an analytic \ntool. \nNevertheless his prodigious intellectual powers persisted unabated. \nIn 1696, the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli challenged his \ncolleagues to solve an unresolved issue called the brachistochrone \nproblem, specifying the curve connecting two points disp laced from \neach other laterally, along which a body, acted upon only by gravity, \nwould fall in the shortest time. Bernoulli originally specified a \ndeadline of six months, but extended it to a year and a half at the \nrequest of Leibniz, one of the leading sc holars of the time, and the \nman who had, independently of Newton, invented the differential \nand integral calculus. The challenge was delivered to Newton at four \np.m. on January 29, 1697. Before leaving for work the next morning,  \nhe had invented an entire new branch of mathematics called the \ncalculus of variations, used it to solve the brachistochrone problem \nand sent off the solution, which was published, at Newton\u2019s request, \nanonymously. But the brilliance and originality of the work   \nThe Harmony of Worlds  \u2014 71 \nbetrayed the identity of its author. When Bernoulli saw the solution, he \ncommented, \u201cWe recognize the lion by his claw.\u201d  \nNewton was then in his fifty -fifth year.  \nThe major intellectual pursuit of his last years was a concordance \nand calibration of the chronologies of ancient civilizations, very much \nin the tradition of the ancient historians Manetho, Strabo and \nEratosthenes. In his last, posthumous work, \u201cThe  \nChronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended,\u201d we find repeated \nastronomical calibrations of historical events; an architectural \nreconstruction of the Temple of Solomon; a provocative claim that all \nthe Northern Hemisphere constellations are named after the \npersonages, artifacts and events in the Greek story of Jason and the \nArgonauts; and the consistent assumption that the gods of all \ncivilizations, with the single exception of Newton\u2019s own, were merely \nancient kings and heroes deified by later generations.  \nKepler and Newton represent a critical transition in human history, \nthe discovery that fairly simple mathematical laws pervade all of \nNature; that the same rules apply on Earth as in the skies; and that \nthere is a resonance between the way we think and the  way the world \nworks. They unflinchingly respected the accuracy of observational \ndata, and their predictions of the motion of the planets to high \nprecision provided compelling evidence that, at an unexpectedly deep \nlevel, humans can understand the Cosmos. Our modern global \ncivilization, our view of the world and our present exploration of the \nUniverse are profoundly indebted to their insights.  \nNewton was guarded about his discoveries and fiercely competitive \nwith his scientific colleagues. He thought nothing of waiting a decade \nor two after its discovery to publish the inverse square law. But before \nthe grandeur and intricacy of Nature, he was, like Ptolemy and Kepler, \nexhilarated as well as disarmingly modest. Just before his death he \nwrote: \u201cI do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself \nI seem to have been only like a boy, playing on the seashore, and \ndiverting myself, in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a \nprettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all \nundiscovered before me.\u201d   \n \n \nComet West, photographed from Earth in February 1976 by Martin Grossman of Gromau, West Germany.

We can lead a full life and never personally \nencounter a natural disaster more violent than a storm. And so we \nbecome complacent, relaxed, unconcerned. But in the history of \nNature, the record is clear. Worlds have been devastate d. Even we \nhumans have achieved the dubious technical distinction of being able \nto make our own disasters, both intentional and inadvertent. On the \nlandscapes of other planets where the records of the pa st have been \npreserved, there is abundant evidence of major catastrophes. It is all a \nmatter of time scale. An event that would be unthinkable in a hundred \n \nyears may be inevitable in a hundred million. Even on the Earth, even \nin our own century, bizarre natural events have occurred.  \nIn the early morning hours of June 30, 1908, in Central Siberia, a \ngiant fireball was seen moving rapidly across the sky. Where it touched \nthe horizon, an enormous explosion took place. It leveled some 2,000 \nsquare kilometers of forest and burned thousands  of trees in a flash \ntire near the impact site. It produced an atmospheric shock wave that \ntwice circled the Earth. For two days afterward, there was so much tine \ndust in the atmosphere that one could read a newspaper at night by \nscattered light in the str eets of London, 10,000 kilometers away.   \n74 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nSoviet geologist L.

Courtesy Sov - foto. \nThe government of Russia under the \nCzars could not be bothered to investigate \nso trivial an event, which, after all, had \noccurred far away, among the backward \nTungus people of Siberia. It was ten years \nafter the Revolution before an expedition \narrived to e xamine the ground and interview \nthe witnesses. These are some of the \naccounts they brought back:  \nEarly in the morning when everyone \nwas asleep in the tent, it was blown up \ninto the air, together with the \noccupants. When they fell back to \nEarth, the whole family suffered slight \nbruises, but Akulina and Ivan actually \nlost consciousness. When they \nregain ed consciousness they heard a \ngreat deal of noise and saw the forest \nblazing round them and much of it \ndevastated.  \nI was sitting in the porch of the house \nat the trading station of Vanovara at \nbreakfast time and looking towards the \nnorth. I had just raised my axe to hoop \na cask, when suddenly . . . the sky was \nsplit in two, and high above the forest the whole northern part of the sky appeared to be covered with \nfire. At that moment I felt a great heat as if my shirt had caught \nfire. . . . I wanted to pull off my shirt and throw it away, but at \nthat moment there was a bang in the sky, and a mighty cras h was \nheard. I was thrown on the ground  \nabout three sajenes away from the porch and for a moment I lost \nconsciousness. My wife ran out and carried me into the hut. The \ncrash was followed by a noise like stones falling from the sky, or \nguns firing. The Earth trembled, and when I lay on the ground  \nI covered my head because I was afraid that stones might hit it. \nAt that moment when the sky opened, a hot wind, as from a \ncannon, blew past the huts from the north. It left its mark on \nthe ground. . . .  \nWhen I sat down to have my breakfast beside my plough, I heard \nsudden bangs, as if from gun -fire. My horse fell to its knees. From \nthe north side above the forest a flame shot up. . . . Then I saw \nthat the fir forest had been bent over by the wind and I th ought \nof a hurricane. I seized hold of my plough with both hands, so \nthat it would not be carried away. The wind was so strong that it \ncarried off some of the soil from the surface of the ground, and \nthen the hurricane drove a wall of water up the Angara. I saw it \nall quite  \nclearly, because my land was on a hillside.  \nThe roar frightened the horses to such an extent that some \ngalloped off in panic, dragging the ploughs in different \ndirections, and others collapsed.  \nThe carpenters, after the first and second crashes, had crossed \nthemselves in stupefaction, and when the third crash resounded \nthey fell backwards from the building onto the chips of wood. \nSome of them were so stunned and utterly terrified that I had to \ncalm them down and reassure  \n \nHeaven and Hell  \u2014 75 \nthem. We all abandoned work and went into the village.  \nThere, whole crowds of local inhabitants were gathered in the \nstreets in terror, talking about this phenomenon.  \nI was in the fields . . . and had only just got one horse harnessed \nto the harrow and begun to attach another when suddenly I \nheard what sounded like a single loud shot to the right. I \nimmediately turned round and saw an elongated flaming object \nflying thr ough the sky. The front part was much broader than \nthe tail end and its color was like fire in the day -time. It was \nmany times bigger than the sun but much dimmer, so that it \nwas possible to look at it with the naked eye. Behind the flames \ntrailed what loo ked like dust. It was wreathed in little puffs, and \nblue streamers were left behind from the flames. . . . As soon as \nthe flame had disappeared, bangs louder than shots from a gun \nwere heard, the ground could be felt to tremble, and the \nwindow panes in the  cabin were shattered.  \n. . . I was washing wool on the bank of the River Kan. Suddenly \na noise like the fluttering of the wings of a frightened bird was \nheard . . . and a kind of swell came up the river. After this came \na single sharp bang so loud that one of the workmen . . . f ell \ninto the water.  \nThis remarkable occurrence is called the Tunguska Event. Some \nscientists have suggested that it was caused by a piece of hurtling \nantimatter, annihilated on contact with the ordinary matter of the \nEarth, disappearing in a flash of gamma rays. But the absen ce of \nradioactivity at the impact site gives no support to this explanation. \nOthers postulate that a mini black hole passed through the Earth in \nSiberia and out the other side. But the records of atmospheric shock \nwaves show no hint of an object booming ou t of the North Atlantic \nlater that day. Perhaps it was a spaceship of some unimaginably \nadvanced extraterrestrial civilization in desperate mechanical trouble, \ncrashing in a remote region of an obscure planet. But at the site of the \nimpact there is no trac e of such a ship. Each of these ideas has been \nproposed, some of them more or less seriously. Not one of them is \nstrongly supported by the evidence. The key point of the Tunguska \nEvent is that there was a tremendous explosion, a great shock wave, an \nenormo us forest fire, and yet there is no impact crater at  \nthe site. There seems to be only one explanation consistent with all \nthe facts: In 1908 a piece of a comet hit the Earth.  \nIn the vast spaces between the planets there are many objects, some \nrocky, some metallic, some icy, some composed partly of organic molecules. They range from grains of \ndust to irregular blocks the size of \nNicaragua or Bhutan. And sometimes, by \naccident, there is a planet in the way. The \nTunguska Event was probably caused by \nan icy cometary fragment about a \nhundred meters across \u2014the si ze of a \nfootball field \u2014weighing a million  \n \nDevastated taiga forest at Tunguska.

The cometary \nimpact and fireball would simulate all effects of a one - megaton \nnuclear burst, including the mushroom cloud, with two excep tions: \nthere would be no gamma radiation or radioactive fallout. Could a \nrare but natural event, the impact of a sizable cometary fragment, \ntrigger a nuclear war? A strange scenario: a small comet hits the Earth, \nas millions of them have, and the response of our civilization is \npromptly to self -destruct. It might be a good idea for us to understand \ncomets and collisions and catastrophes a little better than we do. For \nexample, an American Vela satellite detected an intense double flash \nof light from the vic inity of the South Atlantic and Western Indian \nOcean on September 22, 1979. Early speculation held that it was a \nclandestine test of a low yield (two kilotons, about a sixth the energy \nof the Hiroshima bomb) nuclear weapon by South Africa or Israel. \nThe po litical consequences were considered serious around the world. \nBut what if the flashes were instead caused by the impact  \nof a small asteroid or a piece of a comet? Since airborne overflights in \nthe vicinity of the flashes showed not a trace of unusual radioactivity \nin the air, this is a real possibility and underscores the dangers in an \nage of nuclear weapons of not monitori ng impacts from space better \nthan we do.  \nA comet is made mostly of ice \u2014water (H 2O) ice, with a little \nmethane (CH 4) ice, and some ammonia (NH 3) ice. Striking the Earth\u2019s \natmosphere, a modest cometary fragment would produce a great \nradiant fireball and a mighty blast wave, which would burn trees, level \nforests and be heard around the world. But it might not make much \nof a crater in the ground. Th e ices would all be melted during entry. \nThere would be few recognizable pieces of the comet left \u2014perhaps \nonly a smattering of small grains  148 \u2014 Cosmos  \nDetail from the eleventh -century Bayeux  \nTapestry, recording appearance of \nHalley\u2019s Comet in April 1066.

Meteors are the \nremnants of comets.* Old comets, \nheated by repeated passages near the \nSun, break up, evaporate and \ndisintegrate. The debris spreads to till \nthe full cometary orbit. Where that orbit \nintersects the orbit of the Earth, there i s a swarm of meteors waiting for us. Some part of the swarm is always at \nthe same position in the Earth\u2019s orbit, so the meteor shower is always \nobserved on the same day of every year. June 30, 1908 was the day of \nthe Beta Taurid meteor  \nshower, connected with the orbit of Comet Encke. The Tunguska \nEvent seems to have been caused by a chunk of Comet Encke, a piece \nsubstantially larger than the tiny fragments that cause those glittering, \nharmless meteor showers.  \nComets have always evoked fear and awe and superstition. Their \noccasional apparitions disturbingly challenged the notion of an \nunalterable and divinely ordered Cosmos. It seemed inconceivable \nthat a spectacular streak of milk -white flame, rising and settin g with \nthe stars night after night, was not there for a reason, did not hold \nsome portent for human affairs. So the idea arose that comets were \nharbingers of disaster, auguries of divine wrath \u2014that they foretold the \ndeaths of princes, the fall of kingdoms.  The Babylonians thought that \ncomets were celestial beards. The Greeks thought of flowing hair, the \nArabs of flaming swords. In Ptolemy\u2019s time comets were elaborately \nclassified as \u201cbeams,\u201d \u201ctrumpets,\u201d \u201cjars\u201d and so on, according to their \nshapes. Ptolemy t hought that comets bring wars, hot weather and \n\u201cdisturbed conditions.\u201d Some medieval depictions of comets resem - \nble unidentified flying crucifixes. A Lutheran \u201cSuperintendent\u201d or \nBishop of Magdeburg named Andreas Celichius published in 1578 a \n\u201cTheological Reminder of the New Comet,\u201d which offered the \ninspired view that a comet is \u201cthe thick smoke of human sins, risi ng \nevery day, every hour, every moment, full of stench and horror before \nthe face of God, and becoming gradually so thick as to form a comet, \nwith curled and plaited tresses, which at last is kindled by the hot and \nfiery anger of the Supreme Heavenly Judge .\u201d But others countered that \nif comets were the smoke of sin, the skies would be continually ablaze \nwith them.  \nThe most ancient record of an apparition of Halley\u2019s (or any other) \nComet appears in the Chinese Book of Prince Huai Nan , attendant to \nthe march of King Wu against Zhou of Yin. The year was 1057 B.C. \nThe approach to Earth of Halley\u2019s Comet in the year 66 is the probable \nexplanation of the account by Josephus  \n \n* That meteors and meteorites are connected with the comets was first \nproposed by Alexander von Humboldt in his broad -gauge popularization \nof all of science, published in the years 1845 to 1862, a work called \nKosmos . It was reading Humboldt\u2019s earlier work that fired the young \nCharles Darwin to embark on a career combining geographical \nexploration and natural history. Shortly thereafter he accepted a position \n152 \u2014 Cosmos  \nas naturalist aboard the ship H.M.S. \nBeagle, the event that led to The Origin of  \nSpecies . Heaven and Hell \u2014 153 \nof a sword that hung over Jerusalem for a whole year. In 1066 the \nNormans witnessed another return of Halley\u2019s Comet. Since it must, \nthey thought, presage the fall of some kingdom, the comet encouraged, \nin some sense precipitated, the invasion of England by William the \nConqueror. The comet was duly noted in a newspaper of the time, the \nBayeux Tapestry. In 1301, Giotto, one of the founders of modern \nrealistic painting, witne ssed another apparition of Comet Halley and \ninserted it into a nativity scene. The Gr eat Comet of 1466 \u2014yet another \nreturn of Halley\u2019s Comet \u2014panicked Christian Europe; the Christians \nfeared that God, who sends comets, might be on the side of the Turks, \nwho had just captured Constantinople.  \nThe leading astronomers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries \nwere fascinated by comets, and even Newton became a little giddy over \nthem. Kepler described comets as darting through space \u201cas the fishes \nin the sea,\u201d but being dissipated by sunlight, as  the cometary tail always \npoints away from the sun. David Hume, in many cases an \nuncompromising rationalist, at least toyed with the notion that comets \nwere the reproductive cells \u2014the eggs or sperm \u2014of planetary systems, \nthat planets are produced by a kind of interstellar sex. As an \nundergraduate, before his invention of the reflecting telescope, \nNewton spent many consecutive sleepless nights searching the sky for \ncomets with his naked eye, pursuing them with such fervor that he felt \nill from exhaustion. Fol lowing Tycho and Kepler, Newton concluded \nthat the comets seen from Earth do not move within our atmosphere, \nas Aristotle and others had thought, but rather are more distant than \nthe Moon, although closer than Saturn. Comets shine, as the planets \ndo, by re flected sunlight, \u201cand they are much mistaken who remove \nthem almost as far as the fixed stars; for if it were so, the comets could \nreceive no more light from our Sun than our planets do from the fixed \nstars.\u201d He showed that comets, like planets, move in e llipses: \u201cComets \nare a sort of planets revolved in very eccentric orbits about the Sun.\u201d \nThis demystification, this prediction of regular cometary orbits, led his \nfriend Edmund Halley in 1707 to calculate that the comets of 1531, \n1607 and 1682 were apparit ions at 76 -year intervals of the same \ncomet, and predicted its return in 1758. The comet duly arrived and \nwas named for him posthumously. Comet Halley has played an \ninteresting role in human history, and may be the target of the first \nspace vehicle probe o f a comet, during its return in 1986.  \nModern planetary scientists sometimes argue that the collision of a \ncomet with a planet might make a significant contribution to the \nplanetary atmosphere. For example, all the water in the atmosphere of \nMars today could be accounted for by a recent impact of a small comet. \nNewton noted that the matter in the tails of comets is dissipated in interplanetary space, lost to the comet \nand little by little attracted \ngravitationally to nearby  \n \nHighly stylized representation of the  \nComet of 1556 over a German town, \nprobably Nuremberg.

He believed that the water on \nthe Earth is gradually being lost, \u201cspent \nupon vegetation and putrefaction, and \nconverted into dry earth. . . . The fluids, \nif they are not supplied from without, \nmust be in a continual decrease, and \nquite fail at las t.\u201d Newton seems to have \nbelieved that the Earth\u2019s oceans are of \ncometary origin, and that life is possible \nonly because cometary matter falls upon \nour planet. In a mystical reverie, he went \nstill further: \u201cI suspect, moreover, that it is chiefly from the comets that spirit comes, which is indeed the \nsmallest but the most subtle and useful part of our air, and so much \nrequired to  \nsustain the life of all things with us.\u201d  \nAs early as 1868 the astronomer William Huggins found an identity \nbetween some features in the spectrum of a comet and the spectrum \nof natural or \u201colefiant\u201d gas. Huggins had found organic matter in the \ncomets; in subsequent years cyanogen, CN, consisting o f a carbon and \na nitrogen atom, the molecular fragment that makes cyanides, was \nidentified in the tails of comets. When the Earth was about to pass \nthrough the tail of Halley\u2019s Comet in 1910, many people panicked. \nThey overlooked the fact that the tail of a comet is extravagantly \ndiffuse: the actual danger from the poison in a comet\u2019s tail is far less \nthan the danger, even in 1910, from industrial pollution in large cities.  \nBut that reassured almost no one. For example, headlines in the \nSan Francisco Chronicle for May 15, 1910, include \u201cComet Camera \nas Big as a House,\u201d \u201cComet Comes and Husband Reforms,\u201d \u201cComet \nParties Now Fad in New York.\u201d The Los Angeles Examiner adopted a \nlight mood: \u201cSay!

Entrepreneurs hawked anti -comet pills \nand gas masks, the latter an eerie premonition of the battlefields of \nWorld War I.  \nSome confusion about comets continues to our own time. In 1957, \nI was a graduate student at the University of Chicago\u2019s Yerkes \nObservatory. Alone in the observatory late one night, I heard the \ntelephone ring persistently. When I answered, a voice, betrayin g a well -\nadvanced state of inebriation, said, \u201cLemme talk to a shtrominer.\u201d \n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d \u201cWell, see, we\u2019re havin\u2019 this garden party out here \nin Wilmette, and there\u2019s somethin\u2019 in the sky.

So I told \nhim that he was probably looking at a comet.

At first glance they are, by and large, \nindistinguishable from circles. It is the comets \u2014especially the long -\nperiod comets \u2014that have dramatically elliptical orbits. The planets are \nthe old -timers in the inner solar system; the comets are the n ewcomers. \nWhy are the planetary orbits nearly circular and neatly separated one \nfrom the other? Because if planets had very elliptical orbits, so that \ntheir paths intersec ted, sooner or later there would be a collision. In \nthe early history of  \nthe solar system, there were probably many planets in the process of \nformation. Those with elliptical crossing orbits tended to col-  \n156 \u2014 Cosmos  \nlide and destroy themselves. Those with circular orbits tended to grow \nand survive. The orbits of the present planets are the orbits of the \nsurvivors of this collisional natural selection, the stable middle age of \na solar system dominated by early catastro phic impacts.  \nIn the outermost solar system, in the gloom far beyond the  157 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe head of Comet Halley, May 1910. \nPhotographed at Helwan Observatory,  \nEgypt, with a 30 -inch reflecting telescope by \nH. Knox Shaw.  \n \nComet Humason, photographed with the  \n48-inch Schmidt telescope of the Hale \nObservatories, 1961, and named after its \ndiscoverer, Milton Humason (Chapter 10). \nIn this time exposure, the streaks are distant \nstars. \nplanets, there is a vast spherical cloud of \na trillion cometary nuclei, orbiting the \nSun no faster than a racing car at the \nIndianapolis 500.* A fairly typical comet \nwould look like a giant tumbling snowball about 1 kilometer across. Most never penetrate the border \nmarked by the orbit of Pluto. But occasionally a passing star makes a \ngravitational flurry and commotion in the cometary cloud, and a \ngroup of comets finds itself in highly elliptical orbit s, plunging toward \nthe Sun. After its path is further cha nged by gravitational encounters \nwith Jupiter or Saturn, it tends to find itself, once every century or so, \ncareering toward the inner solar system. Somewhere between the \norbits of Jupiter and Mars it would begin heating and evaporating. \nMatter blown outwa rds from the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, the solar wind, \ncarries fragments of dust and ice back behind the comet, making an \nincipient tail. If Jupiter were a meter across, our comet would be \nsmaller than a speck of dust, but when fully developed, its tail would \nbe as great as the distances between the worlds. When within sight of \nthe Earth on each of its orbits, it would stimulate outpourings of \nsuperstitious fervor among the Earthlings. But eventually they would \nunderstand that it lived not in their atmosphere, but out among the \nplanets. They would calculate its orbit. And perhaps one day soon they \nwould launch a small space vehicle devoted to exploring this visitor \nfrom the realm of the stars.  \nSooner or later comets will collide with planets. The Earth and its \ncompanion the Moon must be bombarded by comets and small \nasteroids, debris left over from the formation of the solar system. Since \nthere are more small objects than large ones, there shoul d be more \nimpacts by small objects than by large ones. An impact of a small \ncometary fragment with the Earth, as at Tunguska, should occur about \nonce every thousand years. But an impact with a large comet, such as \nHalley\u2019s Comet, whose nucleus is perhaps t wenty kilometers across, \nshould occur only about once every billion years.  \nWhen a small, icy object collides with a planet or a moon, it may \nnot produce a very major scar. But if the impacting object is larger or \nmade primarily of rock, there is an explosion on impact  \n \n*The Earth is r = 1 astronomical unit = 150,000,000 kilometers from the Sun. \nIts roughly circular orbit then has a circumference of 2 \u03c0r ~ 109 km.  \nOur planet circulates once along this path every year. One year =  \n3 \u00d7 107 seconds. So the Earth\u2019s orbital speed is 109 km/3 \u00d7  107 sec \u2248 30 \nkm/sec. Now consider the spherical shell of orbiting comets that many \nastronomers believe surrounds the solar system at a distance  \n~100,000 astronomical units, almost halfway to the nearest star. From Kepler\u2019s \nthird law (p. 63) it immediately follows that the orbital period about the Sun \nof any one of them is about (105)3/2 = 107.5 ~ 3 \u00d7 107 or 30 million years. Once \naround the Sun is a long time if you live in the outer reaches of the solar \nsystem. The cometary orbit is 2 \u03c0a = 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 105  \n\u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 108 km ~ 1014 km around, and its speed is therefore only 1014 km/1015 \nsec = 0.1 km/sec ~ 220 miles per hour.  \nHeaven and Hell \u2014 158 \nthat carves out a hemispherical howl called an impact crater. And if \nno process rubs out or fills in the crater, it may last for billions of years. \nAlmost no erosion occurs on the Moon and when we examine its \nsurface, we find it covered with impact craters , many more than can \nbe accounted for by the rather sparse population of cometary and \nasteroidal debris that now fills the inner solar system. The lunar \nsurface offers eloquent testimony of a previous age of the destruction \nof worlds, now billions of years  gone.  \nImpact craters are not restricted to the Moon. We find them \nthroughout the inner solar system \u2014from Mercury, closest to the Sun, \nto cloud -covered Venus to Mars and its tiny moons, Phobos and \nDeimos. These are the terrestrial planets, our family of worlds, t he \nplanets more or less like the Earth. They have solid surfaces, interiors \nmade of rock and iron, and atmospheres ranging from near -vacuum \nto pressures ninety times higher than the Earth\u2019s. They huddle around \nthe Sun, the source of light and heat, like ca mpers around a fire. The \nplanets are all about 4 -6 billion years old. Like the Moon, they all bear \nwitness to an age of impact catastrophism in the early history of the \nsolar system.  \nAs we move out past Mars we enter a very different regime \u2014 the \nrealm of Jupiter and the other giant or jovian planets. These are great \nworlds, composed largely of hydrogen and helium, with smaller \namounts of hydrogen -rich gases such as methane, ammonia and  water. \nWe do not see solid surfaces here, only the atmosphere and the \nmulticolored clouds. These are serious planets, not fragmentary \nworldlets like the Earth. A thousand Earths could fit inside Jupiter. If \na comet or an asteroid dropped into the atmosphe re of Jupiter, we \nwould not expect a visible crater, only a momentary break in the \nclouds. Nevertheless, we know there has been a many -billion -year \nhistory of  \ncollisions in the outer solar system as well \u2014because Jupiter has a great \nsystem of more than a dozen moons, five of which were examined close \nup by the Voyager spacecraft. Here again we find evidence of past \ncatastrophes. When the solar system is all explo red, we will probably \nhave evidence for impact catastrophism on all nine worlds, from \nMercury to Pluto, and on all the smaller moons, comets and asteroids.  \nThere are about 10,000 craters on the near side of the Moon, visible \nto telescopes on Earth. Most of them are in the ancient lunar \nhighlands and date from the time of the final accretion of the Moon \nfrom interplanetary debris. There are about a thousand cr aters larger \nthan a kilometer across in the maria (Latin for \u201cseas\u201d), the lowland \nregions that were flooded, perhaps by lava, shortly after the formation \nof the Moon, covering over the preexisting craters. Thus, very roughly, \ncraters on the Moon should be formed today at the rate of about 109 years/104 craters, = 105 years/crater, a \nhundred thousand years between \ncratering events. Since there may have \nbeen more interplanetary debris a few \nbillion years ago than there is today, we \nmight have to wait even  \n \nBreak -up of Comet West (see frontispiece, \nthis chapter) into four fragments. \nPhotographed by C.

Because the Earth has a larger area than the Moon, we might \nhave to wait something like ten thousand years between collisions that \nwould make craters as big as a kilometer across on our planet. And \nsince Meteor Crater, Arizona, an impact crater about  a kilometer \nacross, has been found to be twenty or thirty thousand years old, the \nobservations on the Earth are in agreement with such crude \ncalculations.  \nThe actual impact of a small comet or asteroid with the Moon \nmight make a momentary explosion sufficiently bright to be visible \nfrom the Earth. We can imagine our ancestors gazing idly up on some \nnight a hundred thousand years ago and noting a strange clou d arising \nfrom the unilluminated part of the Moon, suddenly struck by the \nSun\u2019s rays. But we would not expect such an event to have happened \nin historical times. The odds against it must be something like a \nhundred to one. Nevertheless, there is an histori cal account which \nmay in fact describe an impact on the Moon seen from Earth with the \nnaked eye: On the evening of June 25, 1178, five British monks \nreported something extraordinary, which was later recorded in the \nchronicle of Gervase of Canterbury, gener ally considered a reliable \nreporter on the political and cultural events of his time, after he had \ninterviewed the eyewitnesses who asserted, under oath, the truth of \ntheir story. The chronicle reads:  \nThere was a bright New Moon, and as usual in that phase its \nhorns were tilted towards the east. Suddenly, the upper horn \nsplit in two. From the midpoint of the division, a flaming torch \nsprang up, spewing out fire, hot coals, and  \nsparks.   \nThe astronomers Derral Mulholland and Odile Calame have \ncalculated that a lunar impact would produce a dust cloud rising off \nthe surface of the Moon with an appearance corresponding rather \nclosely to the report of the Canterbury monks.  \nIf such an impact were made only 800 years ago, the crater should \nstill be visible. Erosion on the Moon is so inefficient, because of the \nabsence of air and water, that even small craters a few billion years old \nare still comparatively well preserved. From  the description recorded \nby Gervase, it is possible to pinpoint the sector of the Moon to which \nthe observations refer. Impacts produce rays, linear trails of fine \npowder spewed out during the explosion. Such rays are associated with \nthe very youngest cra ters on the Moon \u2014for example, those named \nafter Aristarchus and Copernicus and Kepler. But while the craters \nmay withstand erosion on the Moon, the rays, being exceptionally \nthin, do not. As time goes on, even the arrival of micrometeorites \u2014\nfine dust from space \u2014stirs up and covers over the rays, and they \ngradually disappear. Thus rays are a signature of a recent impact.  \nThe meteoriticist Jack Hartung has pointed out that a very recent, \nvery fresh -looking small crater with a prominent ray system   \n \nThe rayed crater Bruno (top) on the Moon. \nApollo Orbiter photo.

The telescope is \nthe 82 -inch reflector of McDonald \nObservatory, University of Texas.   \nlies exactly in the region of the Moon referred to by the Canterbury \nmonks. It is called Giordano Bruno after the sixteenth -century Roman \nCatholic scholar who held that there are an infinity of worlds and that \nmany are inhabited. For this and  \nother crimes he was burned at the stake in the year 1600.  \nAnother line of evidence consistent with this interpretation has \nbeen provided by Calame and Mulholland. When an object impacts \nthe Moon at high speed, it sets the Moon slightly wob-  \nbling. Eventually the vibrations die down but not in so short a period \nas eight hundred years. Such a quivering can be studied by laser \nreflection techniques. The Apollo astronauts emplaced in several \nlocales on the Moon special mirrors called laser retror eflectors. When \na laser beam from Earth strikes the mirror and bounces back, the \nround -trip travel time can be measured with remarkable precision. \nThis time multiplied by the speed of light gives us the distance to the \nMoon at that moment to equally remark able precision. Such \nmeasurements, performed over a period of years, reveal the Moon to \nbe librating, or quivering with a period (about three years) and \namplitude (about three meters), consistent with the idea that the crater \nGiordano Bruno was gouged out less than a thousand years ago.  \nAll this evidence is inferential and indirect. The odds, as I have said, \nare against such an event happening in historical times. But the \nevidence is at least suggestive. As the Tunguska Event and Meteor \nCrater, Arizona, also remind us, not all impact cata strophes occurred \nin the early history of the solar system. But the fact that only a few of \nthe lunar craters have extensive ray systems also reminds us that, even \n164 \u2014 Cosmos  \non the Moon, some erosion occurs.* By \nnoting which craters overlap which and \nother signs of  \n* On Mars, where erosion is much more \nefficient, although there are many craters \nthere are virtually no ray craters, as we would \nexpect.   \nHeaven and Hell  \u2014 87 \nlunar stratigraphy, we can reconstruct the sequence of impact and  \nflooding events of which the production of crater Bruno is perhaps \nthe most recent - example. On page 89 is an attempt to visualize the \nevents that made the surface of the lunar hemisphere we see from \nEarth.  \nThe Earth is very near the Moon. If the Moon is so severely cratered \nby impacts, how has the Earth avoided them? Why is Meteor Crater \nso rare? Do the comets and asteroids think it inadvisable to impact an \ninhabited planet? This is an unlikely forbearance. The only possible \nexplanation is that impact craters are formed at very similar rates on \nboth the Earth and the Moon, but that on the airless, waterless Moon \nthey are preserved for immense periods of time, while on the Earth \nslow erosion wipes them out or fills them in. Running water, \nwindblown sand and mountain -building are very slow processes. But \nover millions or billions of years, they are capable of utterly erasing \neven very large impact scars.  \nOn the surface of any moon or planet, there will be external \nprocesses, such as impacts from space, and internal processes, such as \nearthquakes; there will be fast, catastrophic events, such as volcanic \nexplosions, and processes of excruciating slowness, s uch as the pitting \nof a surface by tiny airborne sand grains. There is no general answer \nto the question of which processes dominate, the outside ones or the \ninside ones; the rare but violent events, or the common and \ninconspicuous occurrences. On the Moon , the outside, catastrophic \nevents hold sway; on Earth, the inside, slow processes dominate. Mars \nis an intermediate case.  \nBetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter are countless asteroids, tiny \nterrestrial planets. The largest are a few hundred kilometers across. \nMany have oblong shapes and are tumbling through space. In some \ncases there seem to be two or more asteroids in tight  mutual orbits. \nCollisions among the asteroids happen frequently, and occasionally a \npiece is chipped off and accidentally intercepts the Earth, falling to the \nground as a meteorite. In the exhibits, on the shelves of our museums \nare the fragments of dista nt worlds. The asteroid belt is a great \ngrinding mill, producing smaller and smaller pieces down to motes of \ndust. The bigger asteroidal pieces, along with the comets, are mainly \nresponsible for the recent craters on planetary surfaces. The asteroid \nbelt m ay be a place where a planet was once prevented from forming \nbecause of the gravitational tides of the giant nearby planet Jupiter; or \nit may be the shattered remains of a planet that blew itself up. This \nseems improbable because no scientist on Earth know s how a planet \nmight blow itself up, which is probably just as well.  The rings of Saturn bear some \nresemblance to the asteroid belt: trillions \nof tiny icy moonlets orbiting the planet. \nThey may represent debris prevented by \nthe gravity of Saturn from accreting into \na nearby moon, or they may be the \nremains of a moon  \nThe densely cratered surface, of the lunar \nfarside. Until the advent of space vehicles \nthis view was entirely unknown to the \ninhabitants of Earth. It was first observed by \nthe Luna vehicles of the Soviet Union.

Jupiter an d Uranus also have \nring systems, discovered only recently, and almost invisible from the \nEarth. Whether Neptune has a ring is a problem high on the agenda \nof planetary scientists. Rings may be a typical adornment of Jovian -type \nplanets throughout the cosmo s. \nMajor recent collisions from Saturn to Venus were alleged in a \npopular book, Worlds in Collision,  published in 1950 by a psychiatrist \nnamed Immanuel Velikovsky. He proposed that an object of planetary \nmass, which he called a comet, was somehow generated in the Jupiter \nsystem. Some 3,500 years ago, it careered in toward the inner solar \nsystem and made repeated encounters with the Earth and Mars, having \nas incidental consequences the parting of the Red Sea, allowing Moses \nand the Israelites to escape from Pha roah, and the stopping of the \nEarth from rotating on Joshua\u2019s command. It also caused, he said, \nextensive vulcan - ism and floods.* Velikovsky imagined the comet, \nafter a complicated game of interplanetary billiards, to settle down into \na stable, nearly cir cular orbit, becoming the planet Venus \u2014which he \nclaimed never existed before then.  \nAs I have discussed at some length elsewhere, these ideas are almost \ncertainly wrong. Astronomers do not object to the idea of major \ncollisions, only to major recent  collisions. In any model of the solar \nsystem it is impossible to show the sizes of the planets on the same \nscale as their orbits, because the planets would then  \n \n* As far as I know, the first essentially nonmystical \nattempt to explain a historical event by cometary \nintervention was Edmund Halley\u2019s proposal that \nthe Noachic flood was \u201cthe casual Choc [shock] of \na Comet.\u201d   \nhe almost too small to see. If the planets were really shown to scale, as \ngrains of dust, we would easily note that the chance of collision of a \nparticular comet with the Earth in a few thousand years is \nextraordinarily low. Moreover, Venus is a rocky and metallic, \nhydrogen -poor planet, whereas Jupiter \u2014where Velikovsky supposed it \ncomes from \u2014is made almost entirely of hydrogen. There are no energy \nsources for comets or planets to be ejected by Jupiter. If one passed by \nthe Earth, it could not \u201cstop\u201d the Ear th\u2019s rotation, much less start it \nup again at twenty -four hours a day. No geological evidence supports \nthe idea of an unusual frequency of vulcanism or floods 3,500 years \nago. There are Mesopotamian inscriptions referring to Venus that \npredate the time whe n Velikovsky says Venus changed from a comet \ninto a planet.* It is very unlikely that an object in such a highly \nelliptical orbit could he rapidly moved into the nearly perfectly circular \norbit of present -day Venus. And so on.  \nMany hypotheses proposed by scientists as well as by nonscientists \nturn out to be wrong. But science is a self -correcting enterprise. To be \naccepted, all new ideas must survive rigorous standards of evidence. \nThe worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair is no t that his hypotheses \nwere wrong or in contradiction to firmly established facts, but that \nsome who called themselves scientists attempted to suppress \nVelikovsky\u2019s work. Science is generated by and devoted to free inquiry: \nthe idea that any hypothesis, no matter how strange, deserves to be \nconsidered on its merits. The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may \nbe common in religion and politics, but it is not the path to \nknowledge; it has no place in the endeavor of science. We do not know \nin advance who will discover fundamental new insights.  \nVenus has almost the same mass,3 size, and density as the Earth. As \nthe nearest planet, it has for centuries been thought of as the Earth\u2019s \nsister. What is our sister planet really like? Might it he a balmy, summer \nplanet, a little warmer than the Earth because it is a little closer to t he \nSun? Does it have impact craters, or have they all eroded away? Are \nthere volcanoes? Mountains? Oceans? Life?  \nThe first person to look at Venus through the telescope was Galileo \nin 1609. He saw an absolutely featureless disc. Galileo noted that it \nwent through phases, like the Moon, from a thin crescent to a full \ndisc, and for the same reason: we are sometimes loo king mostly at the \nnight side of Venus and sometimes mostly at the day side, a finding \nthat incidentally reinforced the view that the Earth went around the \nSun and not vice versa.

But for centuries after their \ndiscovery, the composition of those clouds \nremained entirely unknown.  The absence of anything to see on Venus led some scientists to the \ncurious conclusion that the surface was a swamp, like the Earth in the \nCarboniferous Period. The argument \u2014if we can dignify it by such a \nword \u2014went something like this:  \n\u201cI can\u2019t see a thing on Venus.\u201d  \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d  \n\u201cBecause it\u2019s totally covered with clouds.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat are clouds made of?\u201d  \n\u201cWater, of course.\u201d  \n\u201cThen why are the clouds of Venus thicker than the clouds on \nEarth?\u201d  \n\u201cBecause there\u2019s more water there.\u201d  \n\u201cBut if there is more water in the clouds, there must be more \nwater on the surface.

Observation: There was absolutely \nnothing to see on Venus. Conclusion: It must be covered with life. \nThe featureless clouds of Venus reflected our own predispositi ons. We \nare alive, and we resonate with the idea of life elsewhere. But only \ncareful accumulation and assessment of the evidence can tell us \nwhether a given world is inhabited. Venus turns out not to oblige our \npredispositions.  \nThe first real clue to the nature of Venus came from work with a \nprism made of glass or a flat surface, called a diffraction grating, \ncovered with fine, regularly spaced, ruled lines. When an intense beam \nof ordinary white light passes through a narrow sli t and then through \na prism or grating, it is spread into a rainbow of colors called a \nspectrum. The spectrum runs from high frequencies* of visible light \nto low ones \u2014violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. Since we see \nthese colors, it is called the s pectrum of visible light. But there is far \nmore light than the small segment of the spectrum we can see. At \nhigher frequencies, beyond the violet, is a part of the spectrum called \nthe ultraviolet: a perfectly real kind of light, carrying death to the \nmicro bes. It is invisible to us, but readily detectable by bumblebees \nand photoelectric cells.  \nThere is much more to the world than we can see. Beyond the  \n \n* Light is a wave motion; its frequency is the number of wave crests, say, \nentering a detection instrument, such as a retina, in a given unit of time, \nsuch as a second. The higher the frequency, the more energetic the \nradiation.  \n \nHeaven and Hell \u2014 93 \nultraviolet is the X -ray part of the spectrum, and beyond the  \nX-rays are the gamma rays. At lower frequencies, on the other side of \nred, is the infrared part of the spectrum. It was first discovered by \nplacing a sensitive thermometer in what to our eyes is the dark beyond \nthe red. The temperature rose. There was ligh t falling on the \nthermometer even though it was invisible to our eyes. Rattlesnakes \nand doped semiconductors detect infrared radiation perfectly well. \nBeyond the infrared is the vast spectral region of the radio waves. From \ngamma rays to radio waves, all a re equally respectable brands of light. \nAll are useful in astronomy. But because of the limitations of our eyes, \nwe have a prejudice, a bias, toward that tiny rainbow band we call the \nspectrum of visible light.  \nIn 1844, the philosopher Auguste Comte was searching for an \nexample of a sort of knowledge that would be always hidden. He chose \nthe composition of distant stars and planets. We would never \nphysically visit them, he thought, and with no sample in hand it \nseemed we would forever be denied knowledge of their composition. \nBut only three years after Comte\u2019s death, it was discovered that a \nspectrum can be used to determine the chemistry of distant objects. \nDifferent molecules and chemical elements absorb differe nt \nfrequencies or colors of light, sometimes in the visible and sometimes \nelsewhere in the spectrum. In the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere, \na single dark line represents an image of the slit in which light is \nmissing, the absorption of sunlight during its brief passage through \nthe air of another world. Each such line is made by a particular kind \nof molecule or atom. Every substance has its characteristic spectral \nsignature. The gases on Venus can be identified from the Earth, 60 \nmillion kilometers away.  We can divine the composition of the Sun \n(in which helium, named after the Greek sun god Helios, was first \nfound); of magnetic A stars rich in europium; of distant galaxies \nanalyzed through the collective light of a hundred billion constituent stars. Astronomical spectroscopy is an \nalmost magical technique. It amazes me \nstill. Auguste Comte picked a \nparticularly unfortunate  \nA spectrum produced when a bright light \npasses through a slit and then through a \nglass prism. If a gas that strongly absorbed \nvisible light were in the light path, the \nrainbow pattern would be interrupted by a \nset of dark lines characteristic of the gas.  \n \nexample.  \nSchematic diagram of the electromagnetic  \nspectrum, ranging from the shortest  \nwavelengths (gamma rays) to the longest  \n( \nradio waves). The wavelength of light is  \nmeasured in \u00c5ngstroms (\u00c5), micrometers  \n( \n\u00b5 \nm), centimeters (cm) and meters (m).   \n94 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nPhobos, the innermost moon of Mars. \nCrater Stickney is shown at top.

But the first spectroscopic searches, attempted at \nMount Wilson Observatory around 1920, found not a hint, not a \ntrace, of water vapor above the clouds of Venus,  \nsuggesting an arid, desert -like surface, surmounted by clouds of fine \ndrifting silicate dust. Further study revealed enormous quantities of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere, implying to some scientists that all \nthe water on the planet had combined with hyd rocarbons to form \ncarbon dioxide, and that therefore the surface of Venus was a global \noil field, a planet -wide sea of petroleum. Others concluded that there \nwas no water vapor above the clouds because the clouds were very cold, \nthat all the water had cond ensed out into water droplets, which do not \nhave the same pattern of spectral lines as water vapor. They suggested \nthat the planet was totally covered with water \u2014except perhaps for an \noccasional limestone -encrusted island, like the cliffs of Dover. But \nbecause of the vast quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the \nsea could not be ordinary water; physical chemistry required \ncarbonated water. Venus, they proposed, had a vast ocean of seltzer.  \nThe first hint of the true situation came not from spectroscopic \nstudies in the visible or near -infrared parts of the spectrum, but rather \nfrom the radio region. A radio telescope works more like a light meter \nthan a camera. You point it toward some fairly  broad region of the sky, \nand it records how much energy, in a particular radio frequency, is \ncoming down to Earth. We are used to radio signals transmitted by \nsome varieties of intelligent life \u2014namely, those who run radio and \ntelevision stations. But ther e are many other reasons for natural \nobjects to give off radio waves. One is that they are hot. And when, in \n1956, an early radio telescope was turned toward Venus, it was \ndiscovered to be emitting radio waves as if it were at an extremely high \ntemperature . But the real demonstration that the surface of Venus is \nastonishingly hot came when the Soviet spacecraft of the Venera series \nfirst penetrated the obscuring clouds and landed on the mysterious \nand inaccessible surface of the nearest planet. Venus, it tu rns out, is \nbroiling hot. There are no swamps, no oil fields, no seltzer oceans. \nWith insufficient data, it is easy to go wrong.  \nWhen I greet a friend, I am seeing her in reflected visible light, \ngenerated by the Sun, say, or by an incandescent lamp. The light rays \nbounce off my friend and into my eye. But the ancients, including no \nless a figure than Euclid, believed that we see by  virtue of rays somehow \nemitted by the eye and tangibly, actively contacting the object \nobserved. This is a natural notion and can still be encountered, \nalthough it does not account for the invisibility of objects in a \n \ndarkened room. Today we combine a laser \nand a photocell, or a radar transmitter and \na radio telescope, and in this way make \nactive contact by light with distant objects. \nIn radar astronomy, radio waves are \ntransmitted by a telescope on   \nHeaven and Hell \u2014 95 \nEarth, strike, say, that hemisphere of Venus that happens to he  \nfacing the Earth, and bounce hack. At many wavelengths the clouds \nand atmosphere of Venus are entirely transparent to radio waves. \nSome places on the surface will absorb them or, it they are very rough, \nwill scatter them sideways and so will appear dark to  radio waves. By \nfollowing the surface features moving with Venus as it rotates, it was \npossible for the first time to determine reliably the length of its day \u2014\nhow long it takes Venus to spin once on its axis. It turns out that, \nwith respect to the stars, Venus turns once every 245 Earth days, but \nbackwards, in the opposite direction from all other planets in the \ninner solar system. As a result, the Sun rises in the west and sets in \nthe east, taking 118 Earth days from sunrise to sunrise. What is more, \nit presents almost exactly the same face to the Earth each time it is \nclosest to our planet. However the Earth\u2019s gravity has managed to \nnudge Venus into this Earth -locked rotation rate, it cannot have \nhappened rapidly. Venus could not be a mere few thousand ye ars old \nbut, rather, it must be as old as all the other objects in the inner solar \nsystem.  \nRadar pictures of Venus have been obtained, some from ground -\nbased radar telescopes, some from the Pioneer Venus vehicle in orbit \naround the planet. They show provocative evidence of impact craters. \nThere are just as many craters that are not too big or to o small on \nVenus as there are in the lunar highlands, so many that Venus is again \ntelling us that it is very old. But the craters of Venus are remarkably \nshallow, almost as it the high surface temperatures have produced a \nkind of rock that flows over long periods of time, like taffy or putty, \ngradually softening the relief. There are great mesas here, twice as high \nas the Tibetan plateau, an immense rift valley, possibly giant \nvolcanoes and a mountain as high as Everest. We now see before us a \nworld previou sly hidden entirely by clouds \u2014its features first explored \nby radar and by space vehicles.  \nThe surface temperatures on Venus, as deduced from radio \nastronomy and confirmed by direct spacecraft measurements are \naround 480\u00b0C or 900\u00b0F, hotter than the hottest household oven. The \ncorresponding surface pressure is 90 atmospheres, 90 times the \npressur e we feel from the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the equivalent of the \nweight of water 1 kilometer below the surface of the oceans. To \nsurvive tor long on Venus, a space vehicle would have to be \nrefrigerated as well as built like a deep submersible.  \nSomething like a dozen space vehicles from the Soviet Union and \nUnited States have entered the dense Venus atmosphere, and \npenetrated the clouds; a few of them have actually survived for an \nhour or so on the surface.* Two spacecraft in the Soviet  * Pioneer Venus was a successful U.S. \nmission in 1978 -79, combining an  \nA radar map of equatorial latitudes on  \nVenus. Bright regions reflect radio waves \nback to space efficiently. Circles show re - \ngions studied in greater detail, one of which \nis shown below. For a detailed global map of \nVenus see page 340.

Let us follow in the footsteps of these pioneering missions, and visit another world.  \nIn ordinary visible light, the faintly yellowish clouds of Venus can \nbe made out, but they show, as Galileo first noted, virtually no features \nat all. If the cameras look in the ultraviolet, however, we see a graceful, \ncomplex swirling weather system in th e high atmosphere, where the \nwinds are around 100 meters per second, some 220 miles per hour. \nThe atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96 percent carbon dioxide. \nThere are small traces of nitrogen, water vapor, argon, carbon \nmonoxide and other gases, but the  only hydrocarbons or \ncarbohydrates present are there in less than 0.1 parts per million. The \nclouds of Venus turn out to be chiefly a concentrated solution of \nsulfuric acid. Small quantities of hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric \nacid are also present. Eve n at its high, cool clouds, Venus turns out to \nbe a thoroughly nasty place.  \nHigh above the visible cloud deck, at about 70 kilometers altitude, \nthere is a continuous haze of small particles. At 60 kilometers, we \nplunge into the clouds, and find ourselves surrounded by droplets of \nconcentrated sulfuric acid. As we go deeper, the cl oud particles tend \nto get bigger. The pungent gas, sulfur dioxide, SO 2, is present in trace \namounts in the lower atmosphere. It is circulated up above the clouds, \nbroken down by ultraviolet light from the Sun and recombined with \nwater there to form sulfuri c acid \u2014which condenses into droplets, \nsettles, and at lower altitudes is broken down by heat into SO 2 and \nwater again, completing the cycle. It is always raining sulfuric acid on \nVenus, all over the planet, and not a drop ever reaches the surface.  \nThe sulfur -colored mist extends downwards to some 45 kilometers \nabove the surface of Venus, where we emerge into a dense but crystal -\nclear atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure is so high, however, that \nwe cannot see the surface. Sunlight is bounced about b y atmospheric \nmolecules until we lose all images from the surface. There is no dust \nhere, no clouds, just an atmosphere getting palpably denser. Plenty of \nsunlight is transmitted by the overlying clouds, about as much as on \nan overcast day on the Earth.  \nWith searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and  \nof them: Among the instruments aboard one of the Pioneer Venus entry \nprobes was a net flux radiometer, designed to measure simultaneously the \namount of infrared energy flowing upwards and downwards at each \nposition in the Venus atmosphere. The instrument r equired a sturdy \nwindow that was also transparent to infrared radiation. A 13.5 -karat \ndiamond was imported and milled into the desired window. However, the \ncontractor was required to pay a $12,000 import duty. Eventually, the \nU.S. Customs service decided t hat after the diamond was launched to \nVenus it was unavailable for trade on Earth and refunded the money to \nthe manufacturer.  \n \nHeaven and Hell \u2014 97 \neverything suffused in an eerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the  \ngoddess of love than the incarnation of hell. As nearly as we can make \nout, at least some places on the surface are strewn fields of jumbled, \nsoftened irregular rocks, a hostile, barren landscape relieved only here \nand there by the eroded remnants of a der elict spacecraft from a \ndistant planet, utterly invisible through the thick, cloudy, poisonous \natmosphere.*  \nVenus is a kind of planet -wide catastrophe. It now seems reasonably \nclear that the high surface temperature comes about through a massive \ngreenhouse effect. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and clouds \nof Venus, which are semi -transparent to visible l ight, and reaches the \nsurface. The surface being heated endeavors to radiate back into space. \nBut because Venus is much cooler than the Sun, it emits radiation \nchiefly in the infrared rather than the visible region of the spectrum. \nHowever, the carbon dio xide and water vapor4  in the Venus \natmosphere are almost perfectly opaque to infrared radiation, the heat \nof the Sun is efficiently trapped, and the surface temperature rises \u2014\nuntil the little amount of infrared radiation that trickles out of this \nmassive atmosphere just balanc es the sunlight absorbed in the lower \natmosphere and surface.  \n* In this stifling landscape, there is not likely to be anything alive, even \ncreatures very different from us. Organic and other conceivable biological \nmolecules would simply fall to pieces. But, as an indulgence, let us imagine \nthat intelligent life once evolved on such a planet. Would it then invent \nscience? The development of science on Earth was spurred fundamentally by \nobservations of the regularities of the stars and planets. But Venus is \ncompletely cloud -covered. The night is pleasingly long \u2014 about 5 9 Earth days \nlong\u2014but nothing of the astronomical universe would be visible if you looked \nup into the night sky of Venus. Even the Sun would be invisible in the \ndaytime; its light would he scattered and diffused over the whole sky \u2014just as \nscuba divers see only a uniform enveloping radiance beneath the sea. If a radio \ntelescope were built on Venus, it could detect the Sun, the Earth and other \ndistant objects. If astrophysics developed, the existence of stars could \neventually he de-  \nduced from the principles of physics, but they would be theoretical constructs \nonly. I sometimes wonder what their reaction would be if intelligent beings \non Venus one day learned to fly, to sail in the dense air, to penetrate the \n \n4 At the present time there is still a little uncertainty about the abundance of \nwater vapor on Venus. The gas chromatograph on the Pioneer Venus entry \nprobes gave an abundance of water in the lower atmosphere of a few tenths \nof a percent. On the other hand , infrared measurements by the Soviet entry \nvehicles, Veneras 11 and 12, gave an abundance of about a hundredth of a \npercent. If the former value applies, then carbon dioxide and water vapor \nalone are adequate to seal in almost all the heat radiation from the surface mysterious cloud veil 45 kilometers above \nthem and eventually to emerge out the top of \nthe clouds, to look up and for the first time \nwitness that glorious universe of Sun and \nplanets and stars.  \nPlastic construction helmet before (top) \nand after ( bottom)  brief exposure to Venus \nsurface temperatures.

It is fascinating in its own \nright. Many mythic heroes in Greek and \nNorse mythology, after all, made celebrated \nefforts to visit Hell. There is also much to \nbe learned about our planet, a comparative \nHeaven, by comparing it with Hell.  \nThe Sphinx, half human, half lion, was \nconstructed more than  \n5,500 years ago. Its face was once crisp and \ncleanly rendered. It is now softened and \nblurred by thousands of years of Egyptian \ndesert sandblasting and by occasional rains. \nIn New York City there is an obelisk called \nCleopatra\u2019s Needle, which came from \nEgypt. In only about a hundred years in \nthat city\u2019s Central Park, its inscriptions \nhave been almost totally obliterated, because of smog and industrial pollution \u2014chemical erosion like that \nin the atmosphere of Venus. Erosion on Earth slowly wipes out \ninformat ion, but because they are gradual \u2014the patter of a raindrop, \nthe sting of a sand grain \u2014those processes can be missed. Big structures, \nsuch as mountain ranges, survive tens of millions of years; smaller \nimpact craters, perhaps a hundred thousand*; and  \n \nsome other atmospheric constituent is necessary to close the remaining \ninfrared frequency windows in the atmospheric greenhouse. However, the \nsmall quantities of SO 2, CO and HCl, all of which have been detected in \nthe Venus atmosphere, seem adequate for this purpose. Thus recent \nAmerican and Soviet missions to Venus seem to have provided \nverification that the greenhouse effect is indeed the reason for the high \nsurface  temperature.  \n \n* More precisely, an impact crater 10 kilometers in diameter is produced \non the Earth about once every 500,000 years; it would survive erosion for \nabout 300 million years in areas that are geologically stable, such as \nEurope and North America. Smaller crat ers are produced more frequently \nand destroyed more rapidly, especially in geologically active regions.  \n \nHeaven and Hell \u2014  \n \nCrescent Venus in visible light.

There are mighty weather systems on the Earth \u2014and in \nthe high atmosphere of Venus and on Jupiter.  \nThere are sandstorms on the Earth and on Mars; lightning on Jupiter \nand Venus and Earth. Volcanoes inject debris into the atmospheres of \nthe Earth and Io. Internal geological processes slowly deform the \nsurfaces of Venus, Mars, Ganymede and Europa, as well  as Earth. \nGlaciers, proverbial for their slowness, produce major reworkings of \nlandscapes on the Earth and probably also on Mars. These processes \nneed not be constant in time. Most of Europe was once covered with \nice. A few million years ago, the present site of the city of Chicago was \nburied under three kilometers of frost. On Mars, and elsewhere in the \nsolar  \nsystem, we see features that could not be produced today, landscapes \ncarved hundreds of millions or billions of years ago when  \nthe planetary climate was probably very different.  \nThere is an additional factor that can alter the landscape and the \nclimate of Earth: intelligent life, able to make major environmental \nchanges. Like Venus, the Earth also has a greenhouse effect due to its \ncarbon dioxide and water vapor. The global  \ntemperature of the Earth would be below the freezing point of water \nif not for the greenhouse effect. It keeps the oceans liquid and life \npossible. A little greenhouse is a good thing. Like Venus,  \nthe Earth also has about 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide; but it \nresides in the crust as limestone and other carbonates, not in the \natmosphere. If the Earth were moved only a little closer to the Sun, \nthe temperature would increase slightly. This would dr ive some of the \nCO 2 out of the surface rocks, generating a stronger greenhouse effect, \nwhich would in turn incrementally heat the surface further. A hotter \nsurface would vaporize still more carbonates into CO 2, and there \nwould be the possibility of a runaw ay greenhouse effect to very high \ntemperatures. This is just what we think happened in the early history \nof Venus, because of Venus\u2019 proximity to the Sun. The surface \nenvironment of Venus is a warning: something disastrous can happen \nto a planet rather lik e our own.  \nThe principal energy sources of our present industrial civilization \nare the so -called fossil fuels. We burn wood and oil, coal and natural \ngas, and, in the process, release waste gases, principally CO 2, into the \nair. Consequently, the carbon dioxide content of the Earth\u2019s \natmosphere is increasing dramatically. The possibility of a runaway \ngreenhouse effect suggests that we have to be careful: Even a one - or  \ntwo-degree rise in the global temperature can have catastrophic \nconsequences. In the burning of coal and oil and gasoline, we are also \nputting sulfuric acid into the atmosphere. Like Venus, our \nstratosphere even now has a substantial mist of tiny sulfuric acid \ndroplets. Our major cities are polluted with noxious molecules. We \ndo not understand the long -term  189 \nHeaven and Hell \u2014  \neffects of our course of action.  \nBut we have also been perturbing the climate in the opposite sense. \nFor hundreds of thousands of years human beings have been burning \nand cutting down forests and encouraging domestic animals to graze \non and destroy grasslands. Slash -and-burn agriculture, industrial \ntropical deforestation and overgrazing are rampant today. But forests \nare darker than grasslands, and grass-  \nlands are darker than deserts. As a consequence, the amount of \nsunlight that is absorbed by the ground has been declining, and by \nchanges in the land use we are lowering the surface tempera-  \nture of our planet. Might this cooling increase the size of the polar ice \ncap, which, because it is bright, will reflect still more sunlight from \nthe Earth, further cooling the planet, driving a runaway albedo* \neffect?  \nOur lovely blue planet, the Earth, is the only home we know.  \nVenus is too hot. Mars is too cold. But the Earth is just right, a heaven \nfor humans. After all, we evolved here. But our congenial climate may \nbe unstable. We are perturbing our poor planet in serious and \ncontradictory ways. Is there any danger of driving  the environment of \nthe Earth toward the planetary Hell of Venus or the global ice age of \nMars? The simple answer is that nobody knows. The study of the \nglobal climate, the comparison of the Earth with other worlds, are \nsubjects in their earliest stages of  development. They are fields that \nare poorly and grudgingly funded. In our ignorance, we continue to \npush and pull, to pollute the atmosphere and brighten the land, \noblivious of the fact that the long -term consequences are largely \nunknown.  \nA few million years ago, when human beings first evolved on Earth, \nit was already a middle -aged world, 4.6 billion years along from the \ncatastrophes and impetuosities of its youth. But we humans now \nrepresent a new and perhaps decisive factor. Our intellig ence and our \ntechnology have given us the power to affect the climate. How will we \nuse this power? Are we willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency \nin matters that affect the entire human family? Do we value short -term \nadvantages above the welfare of t he Earth? Or will we think on longer \ntime scales, with concern for our children and our grandchildren, to \nunderstand and protect the complex life -support systems of our \nplanet? The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished.  \n * The albedo is the fraction of the \nsunlight striking a planet that is \nreflected back to space. The albedo of \nthe Earth is some 30 to 35 percent. The \nrest of the sunlight is absorbed by the \nground and is responsible for the \naverage surface temperature.  \n \nThe head of the Sphinx, from the \nDescription de L\u2019Egypt,  published in 1809. \nThe paws of the Sphinx were then entirely \nburied in the sand and protected from \nerosion.

The \nastronomer dutifully replied: NOBODY \nKNOWS , NOBODY KNOWS , NOBODY KNOWS  \n. . . 250 times. But despite this confession \nof ignorance, asserted with dogged \npersistence by an expert, no one paid any \nheed, and from that time to this, we hear \nauthoritative pronouncements by those \nwho think they have deduced life on Mars, \nand by thos e who think they have excluded \nit. Some people very much want there to be \nlife on Mars; others very much want there \nto be no life on Mars. There have been \nexcesses in both camps. These strong passions have somewhat frayed the tolerance for ambiguity that is \nessential to science. There seem to be many people who simply wish \nto be told an answer, any answer, and thereby avoid the burden of \nkeeping two mutually exclusive possibilities in their hea ds at the same \ntime. Some scientists have believed that Mars is inhabited on what has \nlater proved to be the flimsiest evidence. Others have concluded the \nplanet is lifeless because  a preliminary search for a particular \nmanifestation of life has been unsuccessful or ambiguous. The blues \nhave been played more than once for the red planet.  \nWhy Martians? Why so many eager speculations and ardent \nfantasies about Martians, rather than, say, Saturnians or Pluton - ians? \nBecause Mars seems, at first glance, very Earthlike. It is the nearest \nplanet whose surface we can see. There are polar ice caps , drifting \nwhite clouds, raging dust storms, seasonally changing patterns on its \nred surface, even a twenty -four-hour day. It is tempting to think of it \nas an inhabited world. Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto \nwhich we have projected our earthly hopes and fears. But our \npsychological predispositions pro or con must not mislead us. All that \nmatters is the evidence, and the evidence is not yet in. The real Mars \nis a world of wonders. Its future prospects are far more intriguing than \nour past apprehe nsions about it. In our time we have sifted the sands \nof Mars, we have established a presence there, we have fulfilled a \ncentury of dreams!  \nNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth \ncentury that this world was being watched keenly and closely by \nintelligences greater than man\u2019s and yet as mortal as his own; \nthat as men busied themselves about their various concerns, they \nwere scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a \nman with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures \nthat swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite \ncomplacency, men went to and fro over this globe about their \nlittle affair s, serene in their assurances of their empire over \nmatter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do \nthe  \n \nBlues for a Red Planet \u2014 107 \nsame. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as \nsources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the \nidea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious \nto recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At mos t, \nterrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, \nperhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary \nenterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds \nas ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellect s vast and \ncool and unsympathetic, regarded this Earth with envious eyes, \nand  \nslowly and surely drew their plans against us.  \nThese opening lines of H. G. Wells\u2019 1897 science fiction classic  \nThe War of the Worlds  maintain their haunting power to this day.* \nFor all of our history, there has been the fear, or hope, that there \nmight be life beyond the Earth. In the last hundred years, that \npremonition has focused on a bright red point of light in the night \nsky. Three  years before The War of the Worlds  was pub-  \nlished, a Bostonian named Percival Lowell founded a major \nobservatory where the most elaborate claims in support of life on Mars \nwere developed. Lowell dabbled in astronomy as a young man, went \nto Harvard, secured a semi -official diplomatic appointment to Korea, \nand otherwise engaged in the usual pursuits of the wealthy. Before he \ndied in 1916, he had made major contributions to our knowledge of \nthe nature and evolution of the planets, to the deduction of the \nexpanding universe and, in a decisive way, to th e discovery of the \nplanet Pluto, which is named after him. The first two letters of the \nname Pluto are the initials of Percival Lowell. Its symbol is   , a \nplanetary monogram.  \nBut Lowell\u2019s lifelong love was the planet Mars. He was electrified by \nthe announcement in 1877 by an Italian astronomer, Giovanni \nSchiaparelli, of canali  on Mars. Schiaparelli had reported during a \nclose approach of Mars to Earth an intricate network of single and \ndouble straight lines crisscrossing the bright areas of the planet. Canali  \nin Italian means channels or grooves, but was promptly translated into \nEnglish as canals,  a word that implies intelligent design. A Mars mania \ncoursed through Europe and Am erica, and Lowell found himself \nswept up with it.  \nIn 1892, his eyesight failing, Schiaparelli announced he was giving \nup observing Mars. Lowell resolved to continue the work. He wanted \na first -rate observing site, undisturbed by clouds or city lights and \nmarked by good \u201cseeing,\u201d the astronomer\u2019s term for a steady \natmosphere through which the shimmering of an   \n* In 1938, a radio version, produced by Orson \nWelles, transposed the Martian invasion from \nEngland to the eastern United States, and \nfrightened millions in war -jittery America into \nbelieving that the Martians were in fact \nattacking.  \nPercival Lowell, aged fifty -nine, in Flagstaff. \nLowell Observatory photograph.  \n \n \nA map of Mars, after that of Schiaparelli.  \nThe straight and curved lines are the \u201ccanals.\u201d Schiaparelli named \nmany features and locales after classical and mythical places, and laid \nthe basis for modern Martian nomenclature, including Chryse and \nUtopia, landing sites of Vikings 1 and 2.   \n108 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nLowell seated at his observatory\u2019s 24 -inch \nrefracting telescope in 1900.

Bad seeing is produced by \nsmall -scale turbulence in the atmosphere \nabove the telescope and is the reason the \nstars twinkle. Lowell built his observatory \nfar away from home, on Mars Hill in \nFlagstaff, Arizon a.* He sketched the \nsurface features of Mars, particularly the \ncanals, which mesmerized him. \nObservations of this sort are not easy. You \nput in long hours at the telescope in the \nchill of the early morning. Often the \nseeing is poor and the image of Mars bl urs \nand distorts. Then you must ignore what \nyou have seen. Occasionally the image \nsteadies and the features of the planet \nflash out momentarily, marvelously. You \nmust then remember what has been \nvouchsafed to you and accurately commit \nit to paper. You must  put your \npreconceptions aside and with an open \nmind set down the wonders of Mars.  Percival Lowell\u2019s notebooks are full of what he thought he saw: \nbright and dark areas, a hint of polar cap, and canals, a planet \nfestooned with canals. Lowell believed he was seeing a globe -girdling \nnetwork of great irrigation ditches, carrying water from the melting \npolar caps to the thirsty inhabitants of the equatorial cities. He \nbelieved the planet to be inhabited by an older and wiser race, perhaps \nvery different from us. He believed that the seasonal changes in the \ndark areas were due to the growth an d decay of vegetation. He believed \nthat Mars was, very closely, Earth -like. All in all, he believed too much.  \nLowell conjured up a Mars that was ancient, arid, withered, a desert \nworld. Still, it was an Earth -like desert. Lowell\u2019s Mars had many \nfeatures in common with the American Southwest, where the Lowell \nObservatory was located. He imagined the Martian tempera tures a \nlittle on the chilly side but still as comfortable as \u201cthe South of \nEngland.\u201d The air was thin, but there was enough oxygen to be \nbreathable. Water was rare, but the elegant network of canals carried \nthe life -giving fluid all over the planet.  \nWhat was in retrospect the most serious contemporary challenge to \nLowell\u2019s ideas came from an unlikely source. In 1907, Alfred Russel \nWallace, co -discoverer of evolution by natural selection, was asked to \nreview one of Lowell\u2019s books. He had been an engine er in his youth \nand, while somewhat credulous on such issues as extrasensory \nperception, was admirably skeptical on the habitability of Mars. \nWallace showed that Lowell had erred in his calculation of the average \ntemperatures on Mars; instead of being as t emperate as the South of \nEngland, they were, with few exceptions, everywhere below the \nfreezing point of water. There should be permafrost, a perpetually \nfrozen subsurface.  \n \n* Isaac Newton had written \u201cIf the Theory of making Telescopes could at \nlength he fully brought into practice, yet there would be certain Bounds \nbeyond which Telescopes could not perform. For the Air through which \nwe look upon the Stars, is in perpetual tr emor. . . . The only remedy is the \nmost serene and quiet Air, such as may perhaps be found on the tops of \nthe highest mountains above the grosser Clouds.\u201d  \n \nBlues for a Red Planet \u2014 109 \nThe air was much thinner than Lowell had calculated.  \nCraters should be as abundant as on the Moon. And as for the water \nin the canals:  \nAny attempt to make that scanty surplus [of water], by means of \noverflowing canals, travel across the equator into the opposite \nhemisphere, through such terrible desert regions and exposed \nto such a cloudless sky as Mr. Lowell describes, would be the \nwork of a body of madmen rather than of intelligent beings. It \nmay be safely asserted that not one drop of water would escape \nevaporation or insoak at even a hundred miles from its source.  \nThis devastating and largely correct physical analysis was written in \nWallace\u2019s eighty -fourth year. His conclusion was that life on Mars \u2014by \nthis he meant civil engineers with an interest in hydraulics \u2014was \nimpossible. He offered no opinion on microorganisms . \nDespite Wallace\u2019s critique, despite the fact that other astronomers \nwith telescopes and observing sites as good as Lowell\u2019s could find no \nsign of the fabled canals, Lowell\u2019s vision of Mars gained popular \nacceptance. It had a mythic quality as old as Genesi s. Part of its appeal \nwas the fact that the nineteenth century was an age of engineering \nmarvels, including the construction of enormous canals: the Suez \nCanal, completed in 1869; the Corinth Canal, in 1893; the Panama \nCanal, in 1914; and, closer to home, the Great Lake locks, the barge \ncanals of upper New York State, and the irrigation canals of the \nAmerican Southwest. If Europeans and Americans could perform \nsuch feats, why not  \nMartians? Might there not be an even more elaborate effort by an older \nand wiser species, courageously battling the advance of desiccation on \nthe red planet?  \nWe have now sent reconnaissance satellites into orbit around  \nMars. The entire planet has been mapped. We have landed two \nautomated laboratories on its surface. The mysteries of Mars have, if \nanything, deepened since Lowell\u2019s day. However, with pictures far \nmore detailed than any view of Mars that Lowell could have g limpsed, \nwe have found not a tributary of the vaunted canal network, not one \nlock. Lowell and Schiaparelli and others, doing visual observations \nunder difficult seeing con-  \nditions, were misled \u2014in part perhaps because of a predisposition to \nbelieve in life on Mars.  \nThe observing notebooks of Percival Lowell reflect a sustained effort \nat the telescope over many years. They show Lowell to have been well \naware of the skepticism expressed by other astronomers about the \nreality of the canals. They reveal a man convinced t hat he has made an important discovery and distressed that \nothers have not yet understood its \nsignificance. In his notebook for 1905, \nfor example, there is an entry on January \n21: \u201cDouble canals came out by flashes, \nconvincing of reality.\u201d In  \nreading Lowell\u2019s notebooks I have the \ndistinct but uncomfortable  \n  \nOne of the globes of Mars, showing \nprominent named canals, prepared by \nLowell.

But what?  \nWhen Paul Fox of Cornell and I compared Lowell\u2019s maps of Mars \nwith the Mariner 9 orbital imagery \u2014sometimes with a resolution a \nthousand times superior to that of Lowell\u2019s Earth - bound twenty -four-\ninch refracting telescope \u2014we found virtually no correlation at all. It \nwas not that Lowell\u2019s eye had strung up disconnected fine detail on \nthe Martian surface into illusory straight lines. There was no dark \nmottling or crater chains in the position of most of his canals. There \nwere no features there at all. Then ho w could he have drawn the same \ncanals year after year?  \nHow could other astronomers \u2014some of whom said they had not \nexamined Lowell\u2019s maps closely until after their own observations \u2014\nhave drawn the same canals? One of the great findings of  \nthe Mariner 9 mission to Mars was that there are time -variable streaks \nand splotches on the Martian surface \u2014many connected with the \nramparts of impact craters \u2014which change with the seasons. They are \ndue to windblown dust, the patterns varying with the seas onal winds. \nBut the streaks do not have the character of the canals, they are not in \nthe position of the canals, and none of them is large enough \nindividually to be seen from the Earth in the first place. It is unlikely \nthat there were real features on Mar s even slightly resembling Lowell\u2019s \ncanals in the first few decades of this century that have disappeared \nwithout a trace as soon as close -up spacecraft investigations became \npossible.  \nThe canals of Mars seem to be some malfunction, under difficult \nseeing conditions, of the human hand/eye/brain combination (or at \nleast for some humans; many other astronomers, observing with \nequally good instruments in Lowell\u2019s time and after, claimed the re \nwere no canals whatever). But this is hardly a comprehensive \nexplanation, and I have the nagging suspicion that some essential \nfeature of the Martian canal problem still  \nremains undiscovered. Lowell always said that the regularity of the \ncanals was an unmistakable sign that they were of intelligent origin. \nThis is certainly true. The only unresolved question was which side of \nthe telescope the intelligence was on.  \nLowell\u2019s Martians were benign and hopeful, even a little godlike, \nvery different from the malevolent menace posed by Wells and Welles \nin The War of the Worlds . Both sets of ideas passed into the public \nimagination through Sunday supplements and science fiction. I can \nremember as a child reading with breathless fascination the Mars \nnovels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. I journeyed with John Carter, \n \ngentleman adventurer from Virginia, to \n\u201cBar- soom,\u201d as Mars was known to its \ninhabitants. I followed herds of eight -legged \nbeasts of burden, the thoats. I won the \nhand of the lovely Dejah Thoris, Princess of \nHelium. I befriended a four - meter -high \ngreen fi ghting man named Tars Tarkas. I \nwandered within the spired cities and \ndomed pumping stations of Barsoom, and \nalong the verdant banks of the Nilosyrtis \nand Nepenthes canals.   \nBlues for a Red Planet  \u2014 111 \nMight it really be possible \u2014in fact and not in fancy \u2014to venture  \nwith John Carter to the Kingdom of Helium on the planet Mars? \nCould we venture out on a summer evening, our way illuminated by \nthe two hurtling moons of Barsoom, for a journey of high scientific \nadventure? Even if all Lowell\u2019s conclusions about Mars, inclu ding the \nexistence of the fabled canals, turned out to be bankrupt, his depiction \nof the planet had at least this virtue: it aroused generations of eight -\nyear-olds, myself among them, to consider the exploration of the \nplanets as a real possibility, to won der if we ourselves might one day \nvoyage to Mars. John Carter got there by standing in an open field, \nspreading his hands and wishing. I can remember spending many an \nhour in my boyhood, arms resolutely outstretched in an empty field, \nimploring what I beli eved to be Mars to transport me there. It never \nworked. There had to be some other way.  \nLike organisms, machines also have their evolutions. The rocket \nbegan, like the gunpowder that first powered it, in China where it was \nused for ceremonial and aesthetic purposes. Imported to Europe \naround the fourteenth century, it was applied to warfare, discussed in \nthe late nineteenth century as a means of transportation to the planets \nby the Russian schoolteacher Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and first \ndeveloped seriously for high altitude flight by the American scientist \nRobert Goddard. The German V -2 milita ry rocket of World War II \nemployed virtually all of Goddard\u2019s innovations and culminated in \n1948 in the two - stage launching of the V -2/WAC Corporal \ncombination to the then -unprecedented altitude of 400 kilometers. In \nthe 1950\u2019s, engineering advances organ ized by Sergei Korolov in the \nSoviet Union and Wernher von Braun in the United States, funded \nas delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, led to the first \nartificial satellites. The pace of progress has continued to be brisk: \nmanned orbital flight ; humans orbiting, then landing on the moon; \nand unmanned spacecraft outward bound throughout the solar \nsystem. Many other nations have now launched spacecraft, including \nBritain, France, Canada, Japan and China, the society that invented \nthe rocket in the  first place.  \nAmong the early applications of the space rocket, as Tsiolkovsky \nand Goddard (who as a young man had read Wells and had been \nstimulated by the lectures of Percival Lowell) delighted in imagining, \nwere an orbiting scientific station to monitor the Earth fro m a great \nheight and a probe to search for life on Mars. Both these dreams have \nnow been fulfilled.  \nImagine yourself a visitor from some other and quite alien planet, \napproaching Earth with no preconceptions.

There is no sign of \nlife, intelligent or otherwise, in places we \ncall Washington, New York, Boston, \nMoscow, London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and \nPeking. If there are intelligent beings on \nEarth , they have not much modified the \nlandscape into regular geometrical patterns \nat kilometer resolution.  \nBut when we improve the resolution \ntenfold, when we begin to see detail as \nsmall as a hundred meters across, the \nsituation changes. Many places on Earth \nseem suddenly to crystallize out, revealing \nan intricate pattern of squares and \nrectangles, straight li nes and circles. These \nare, in fact, the engineering artifacts of intelligent beings: roads, highways, canals, farmland, city streets \u2014a \npattern disclosing the twin human passions for Euclidean geometry \nand territoriality. On this scale, intelligent life ca n be discerned in \nBoston and Washington and New York. And at ten -meter resolution, \nthe degree to which the landscape has been reworked first really \nbecomes evident. Humans have been very busy. These photos have \nbeen taken in daylight. But at twilight or du ring the night, other things \nare visible: oil -well fires in Libya and the Persian Gulf; deepwater \nillumination by the Japanese squid fishing fleet; the bright lights of \nlarge cities. And if, in daylight, we improve our resolution so we can \nmake out things that are a meter across, then we begin to detect for \nthe first time individual organisms \u2014whales, cows, flamingos, people.  \nIntelligent life on Earth first reveals itself through the geometric \nregularity of its constructions. If Lowell\u2019s canal network really existed, \nthe conclusion that intelligent beings inhabit Mars might be similarly \ncompelling. For life to be detected on Ma rs photographically, even \nfrom Mars orbit, it must likewise have accomplished a major \nreworking of the surface. Technical civilizations, canal builders, might \nbe easy to detect. But except for one or two enigmatic features, nothing \nof the sort is apparent in the exquisite profusion of Martian surface \ndetail uncovered by unmanned spacecraft. However, there are many \nother possibilities, ranging from large plants and animals to \nmicroorganisms, to extinct forms, to a planet that is now and was \nalways lifeless. Because Mars is farther from the Sun than is the Earth, \nits temperatures are considerably lower. Its air is thin, containing \nmostly carbon dioxide but also some molecular nitrogen and argon \nand very small quantities of water vapor, oxygen and ozone. Open \nbodies of liquid water are impossible today because the atmospheric \npressure on Mars is too low to keep even cold water from rapidly \nboiling. There may be minute quantities of liquid water in pores and \ncapillaries in the soil. The amount of oxygen is far to o little for a \nhuman being to breathe. The ozone abundance is so small that \ngermicidal ultraviolet radiation from the Sun strikes the Martian \nsurface unimpeded. Could any organism survive in such an \nenvironment?  \n \nBlues for a Red Planet \u2014 113 \nTo test this question, many years ago my colleagues and I  \nprepared chambers that simulated the Martian environment as it was \nthen known, inoculated them with terrestrial microorganisms and \nwaited to see if anybody survived. Such chambers are called, of course, \nMars Jars. The Mars Jars cycled the temperatures with in a typical \nMartian range from a little above the freezing point around noon to \nabout \u201480\u00b0C just before dawn, in an anoxic atmosphere composed \nchiefly of CO 2 and N 2. Ultraviolet lamps reproduced the fierce solar \nflux. No liquid water was present except fo r very thin films wetting \nindividual sand grains. Some microbes froze to death after the first \nnight and were never heard from again. Others gasped and perished \nfrom lack of oxygen. Some died of thirst, and some were fried by the \nultraviolet light. But the re were always a fair number of varieties of \nterrestrial microbes that did not need oxygen; that temporarily closed \nup shop when the temperatures dropped too low; that hid from the \nultraviolet light under pebbles or thin layers of sand. In other \nexperiment s, when small quantities of liquid water were present, the \nmicrobes actually grew. If terrestrial microbes can survive the Martian \nenvironment, how much better Martian microbes, if they exist, must \ndo on Mars. But first we must get there.  \nThe Soviet Union maintains an active program of unmanned \nplanetary exploration. Every year or two the relative positions of the \nplanets and the physics of Kepler and Newton permit the launch of a \nspacecraft to Mars or Venus with a minimum expenditure of en ergy. \nSince the early 1960\u2019s the U.S.S.R. has missed few such opportunities. \nSoviet persistence and engineering skills have eventually paid off \nhandsomely. Five Soviet spacecraft \u2014Veneras 8 through 12 \u2014have \nlanded on Venus and successfully returned data from  the surface, no \ninsignificant feat in so hot, dense and corrosive a planetary \natmosphere. Yet despite many attempts, the Soviet Union has never \nlanded successfully on Mars \u2014a place that, at least at first sight, seems \nmore hospitable, with chilly temperatu res, a much thinner atmosphere \nand more benign gases; with polar ice caps, clear pink skies, great sand \ndunes, ancient river beds, a vast rift valley, the largest volcanic \nconstruct, so far as we know, in the solar system, and balmy equatorial \nsummer after noons. It is a far more Earth -like world than Venus.  \nIn 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 spacecraft entered the Martian \natmosphere. According to the information automatically radioed \nback, it successfully deployed its landing systems during entry, \ncorrectly oriented its ablation shield downward, properly unfurled its  \ngreat parachute and fired its retro -rockets near the end of its descent \npath. According to the data returned by Mars 3, it should have landed \nsuccessfully on the red planet.

In 1973, a quite similar sequence of events occurred with  \nthe Mars 6 lander, in that case the failure occurring within one second \nof touchdown. What went wrong?  \nThe first illustration I ever saw of Mars 3 was on a Soviet postage \nstamp (denomination, 16 kopecks), which depicted the spacecraft \ndescending through a kind of purple muck. The artist was trying, I \nthink, to illustrate dust and high winds: Mars 3 had ente red the \nMartian atmosphere during an enormous global dust storm. We have \nevidence from the U.S. Mariner 9 mission that near -surface winds of \nmore than 140 meters per second \u2014faster than half the speed of sound \non Mars \u2014arose in that storm. Both our Soviet co lleagues and we think \nit likely that these high winds caught the Mars 3 spacecraft with \nparachute unfurled, so that it landed gently in the vertical direction \nbut with breakneck speed in the horizontal direction. A spacecraft \ndescending on the shrouds of a  large parachute is particularly \nvulnerable to horizontal winds. After landing, Mars 3 may have made \na few bounces, hit a boulder or other example of Martian relief, tipped \nover, lost the radio link with its carrier \u201cbus\u201d and failed.  \nBut why did Mars 3 enter in the midst of a great dust storm?  \nThe Mars 3 mission was rigidly organized before launch. Every step it \nwas to perform was loaded into the on -board computer before it left \nEarth. There was no opportunity to change the computer program, \neven as the extent of the great 1971 dust storm became  clear. In the \njargon of space exploration, the Mars 3 mission was preprogrammed, \nnot adaptive. The failure of Mars 6 is more mysterious. There was no \nplanet -wide storm when this spacecraft entered the Martian \natmosphere, and no reason to suspect a local s torm, as sometimes \nhappens, at the landing site. Perhaps there was an engineering failure \njust at the moment of touchdown. Or perhaps there is something \nparticularly dangerous about the Martian surface.  \nThe combination of Soviet successes in landing on Venus and \nSoviet failures in landing on Mars naturally caused us some concern \nabout the U.S. Viking mission, which had been informally scheduled \nto set one of its two descent craft gently down on the Martia n surface \non the Bicentennial of the United States, July 4, 1976. Like its Soviet \npredecessors, the Viking landing maneuver involved an ablation \nshield, a parachute and retro -rockets. Because the Martian atmosphere \nis only 1 percent as dense as the Earth\u2019s , a very large parachute, \neighteen meters in diameter, was deployed to slow the spacecraft as it \nentered the thin air of Mars. The atmosphere is so thin that if Viking \nhad landed at a high elevation there would not have been enough \natmosphere to brake the descent adequately: it would have crashed. \nOne requirement, therefore, was for a landing site in a low -lying region. From Mariner 9 results and \nground -based radar studies, we knew \nmany such areas.  \nNorth America at night, its configuration \noutlined by the lights of large cities.

To avoid the probable fate of Mars 3, we wanted Viking to land in \na place and time at which the winds were low. Winds that would make \nthe lander crash were probably strong enough to lift dust off the \nsurface. If we could check that the candidate landing si te was not \ncovered with shifting, drifting dust, we would have at least a fair \nchance of guaranteeing that the winds were not intolerably high. This \nwas one reason that each Viking lander was carried into Mars orbit \nwith its Orbiter, and descent delayed un til the Orbiter surveyed the \nlanding site. We had discovered with Mariner 9 that characteristic \nchanges in the bright and dark patterns on the Martian surface occur \nduring times of high winds. We certainly would not have certified a \nViking landing site as safe if orbital photographs had shown such \nshifting patterns. But our guarantees could not be 100 percent \nreliable. For example, we could imagine a landing site at which the \nwinds were so strong that all mobile dust had already been blown \naway. We would th en have had no indication of the high winds that \nmight have been there. Detailed weather predictions for Mars were, of \ncourse, much less reliable than for Earth. (Indeed one of the many \nobjectives of the Viking mission was to improve our understanding of \nthe weather on both planets.)  \nBecause of communication and temperature constraints, Viking \ncould not land at high Martian latitudes. Farther poleward than about \n45 or 50 degrees in both hemispheres, either the time of useful \ncommunication of the spacecraft with the Earth or the period during \nwhich the spacecraft would avoid dangerously low temperatures would \nhave been awkwardly short.  \nWe did not wish to land in too rough a place. The spacecraft  \n \nA Soviet postage stamp illustrating the \ndescent of the Mars 3 spacecraft, still in its \nablation shield, through a raging dust \nstorm on December 2, 1971.  \nmight have tipped over and crashed, or \nat the least its mechanical arm, intended \nto acquire Martian soil samples, might \nhave be-  come wedged or been left waving helplessly a meter too high above \nthe surface. Likewise, we did not want to land in places that were too \nsoft. If the spacecraft\u2019s three landing pods had sunk deeply into a \nloosely packed soil, various undesirable consequenc es would have \nfollowed, including immobilization of the sample arm. But we did not \nwant to land in a place that was too hard either \u2014had we landed in a \nvitreous lava field, for example, with no powdery surface material, the \nmechanical arm would have been un able to acquire the samples vital \nto the projected chemistry and biology experiments.  \nThe best photographs then available of Mars \u2014from the Mariner 9 \nOrbiter \u2014showed features no smaller than 90 meters (100 yards) \nacross. The Viking Orbiter pictures improved this figure only slightly. \nBoulders one meter (three feet) in size were entirely invis ible in such \nphotographs, and could have had disastrous consequences for the \nViking lander. Likewise, a deep, soft powder might have been \nundetectable photographically. Fortunately, there was a technique \n \nthat enabled us to determine the \nroughness or softness of a candidate \nlanding site: radar. A very   \nBlues for a Red Planet \u2014 119 \nrough place would scatter radar from Earth off to the sides of the  \nbeam and therefore appear poorly reflective, or radar -dark. A very soft \nplace would also appear poorly reflective because of the many \ninterstices between individual sand grains. While we were unable to \ndistinguish between rough places and soft places, we d id not need to \nmake such distinctions for landing -site selection. Both, we knew, were \ndangerous. Preliminary radar surveys suggested that as much as a \nquarter to a third of the surface area of Mars might be radar -dark, and \ntherefore dangerous for Viking. B ut not all of Mars can be viewed by \nEarth -based radar \u2014only a swath between about 25\u00b0N and about 25\u00b0S. \nThe Viking Orbiter carried no radar system of its own to map the \nsurface.  \nThere were many constraints \u2014perhaps, we feared, too many. Our \nlanding sites had to be not too high, too windy, too hard, too soft, too \nrough or too close to the pole. It was remarkable that there were any \nplaces at all on Mars that simultaneously satisfied  all our safety criteria. \nBut it was also clear that our search for safe harbors had led us to \nlanding sites that were, by and large, dull.  \nWhen each of the two Viking orbiter -lander combinations was \ninserted into Martian orbit, it was unalterably committed to landing \nat a certain latitude  on Mars. If the low point in the orbit was at 21\u00b0 \nMartian north latitude, the lander would touch down at 21\u00b0N, \nalthough, by waiting for the planet to turn beneath it, it could land at \nany longitude  whatever. Thus the Viking science teams selected \ncandidate latitudes for which there was more than one promising site. \nViking 1 was targeted for 21\u00b0N. The prime si te was in a region called \nChryse (Greek for \u201cthe land of gold\u201d), near the confluence of four \nsinuous channels thought to have been carved in previous epochs of \nMartian history by running water. The Chryse site seemed to satisfy all \nsafety criteria. But the  radar observations had been made nearby, not \nin the Chryse landing site itself. Radar observations of Chryse were \nmade for the first time \u2014because of the geometry of Earth and Mars \u2014\nonly a few weeks before the nominal landing date.  \nThe candidate landing latitude for Viking 2 was 44\u00b0N; the prime \nsite, a locale called Cydonia, chosen because, according to some \ntheoretical arguments, there was a significant chance of small \nquantities of liquid water there, at least at some time during t he \nMartian year. Since the Viking biology experiments were strongly \noriented toward organisms that are comfortable in liquid water, some \nscientists held that the chance of Viking finding life would be \nsubstantially improved in Cydonia. On the other hand, i t was argued \nthat, on so windy a planet as Mars, microorganisms should be \neverywhere if they are anywhere. There seemed to be merit to both positions, and it was difficult to decide \nbetween them. What was quite clear, \nhowever, was that 44\u00b0N was completely \ninaccessible to radar site -certification; we \nhad to accept a significant risk of failure \nwith Viking 2 if it was committed  \n \nPortions of the great Mariner Valley,  \nVallis Marineris. Discovered in 1971 -72 by \nMariner 9, it is 5,000 kilometers long and \nroughly 100 kilometers wide.

It was sometimes argued that if Viking  \n1 \n was down and working well we could afford to accept a greater  \nrisk with Viking 2. I found myself making very conservative  \nrecommendations on the fate of a billion -dollar mission. I could  \nimagine, for example, a key instrument failure in Chryse just after  \nan unfortunate crash landing in Cydonia. To improve the Viking  \noptions, additional landing sites, geologically very different from  \nChryse and Cydonia, were selected in the radar -certified region  \nnear 4\u00b0 S latitude. A decision on whether Viking 2 would set  \ndown at high or at low latitude was not made until virtually the  \nlast minute, when a place with the hopeful name of Utopia, at  \nthe same latitude as Cydonia, was chosen.  \nFor Viking 1, the original landing site seemed, after we exam-  \nined Orbiter photographs and late -breaking Earth -based radar  \ndata, unacceptably risky. For a while I worried that Viking 1 had  \nbeen condemned, like the legendary Flying Dutchman, to wan-  \nder the skies of Mars forever, never to find safe haven. Eventu-  \nally we found a suitable spot, still in Chryse but far from the  \nconfluence of the four ancient channels. The delay prevented us  \nfrom setting down on July 4, 1976, but it was generally agreed  \nthat a crash landing on that date would have been an unsatisfac-  \ntory two hundredth birthday present for the United States. We  \ndeboosted from orbit and entered the Martian atmosphere six-  \nteen days later.  \nAfter an interplanetary voyage of a year and a half, covering a  \nhundred million kilometers the long way round the Sun, each  \nOrbiter/lander combination was inserted into its proper orbit  \nabout Mars; the orbiters surveyed candidate landing sites; the  \nlanders entered the Martian atmosphere on radio command and   \nof the four great volcanoes in Tharsis on \nMars and the western provinces of Vallis \nMarineris.

In Chryse and Utopia, for the first \ntime in human history, spacecraft had touched down, gently and \nsafely, on the red planet. These triumphant landings were due in \nconsiderable part to the great skill invested in their d esign, fabrication \nand testing, and to the abilities of the spacecraft controllers. But for \nso dangerous and mysterious a planet as Mars, there was also at least \nan element of luck.  \nImmediately after landing, the first pictures were to be returned. \nWe knew we had chosen dull places. But we could hope. The first \npicture taken by the Viking 1 lander was of one of its own footpads \u2014\nin case it were to sink into Martian quicksand, we wanted  to know \nabout it before the spacecraft disappeared. The picture built up, line \nby line, until with enormous relief we saw the footpad sitting high and \ndry above the Martian surface. Soon other pictures came into being, \neach picture element radioed individ ually back to Earth.  \nI remember being transfixed by the first lander image to show the \nhorizon of Mars. This was not an alien world, I thought. I knew places \nlike it in Colorado and Arizona and Nevada. There were rocks and \nsand drifts and a distant eminence, as natural and uns elfconscious as \nany landscape on Earth. Mars was a place.  I would, of course, have \nbeen surprised to see a grizzled prospector emerge from behind a dune \nleading his mule, but at the same time the idea seemed appropriate. \nNothing remotely like it ever enter ed my mind in all the hours I spent \nexamining the Venera 9 and 10 images of the Venus surface. One way \nor another, I knew,  \nthis was a world to which we would return.  \nThe landscape is stark and red and lovely: boulders thrown out in \nthe creation of a crater somewhere over the horizon, small sand dunes, \nrocks that have been repeatedly covered and uncovered by drifting \ndust, plumes of fine -grained material blown about by the winds. \nWhere did the rocks come from? How much sand has been blown by \nwind? What must the previous history of the planet have been to \ncreate sheared rocks, buried boulders, polygonal gouges in the \nground? What are the rocks made of? The same materials as the sand? \nIs the sand merely pulverized rock or something else? Why is the sky \npink? What is the air made of? How fast does the wind blow? Are there \nmarsquakes? How does the atmospheric pressure and the appearance \nof the landscape change with the season s? \nFor every one of these questions Viking has provided definitive or \nat least plausible answers. The Mars revealed by the Viking mission is \nof enormous interest \u2014particularly when we remember that the \nlanding sites were chosen for their dullness. But the came ras revealed no sign of canal builders, no Barsoo - \nmian aircars or short swords, no \nprincesses or fighting men, no thoats, no \nfootprints, not even a cactus or a \nkangaroo rat.

This painting \nby Don Davis, made before the landing, \nshows a descent over the original Chryse \nlanding site. From data obtained after \nlanding, we now know that the Martian sky \nis not blue, but rather a kind of yellow -pink, \ndue to suspended fine rusty particles.  \nfar as we could see, there was not a sign of \nlife.* \nPerhaps there are large lifeforms on \nMars, but not in our two landing sites. \nPerhaps there are smaller forms in every rock and sand grain. For most of its history, those regions of the Earth \nnot covered by water looked rather like Mars today \u2014with an \natmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, with ultraviolet light shining \nfiercely down on the surface through an atmosphere devoid of ozone. \nLarge plants and animals did not colonize the land until the last 10 \npercent of Earth history. And yet for three billion years t here were \nmicroorganisms everywhere on Earth. To look  \nfor life on Mars, we must look for microbes.  \nThe Viking lander extends human capabilities to other and alien \nlandscapes. By some standards, it is about as smart as a grasshopper; \nby others, only as intelligent as a bacterium. There is nothing \ndemeaning in these comparisons. It took nature hundreds of  millions \nof years to evolve a bacterium, and billions to make a grasshopper. \nWith only a little experience in this sort of business, we are becoming \nfairly skillful at it. Viking has two eyes as we do, but they also work in \nthe infrared, as ours do not; a  sample arm that can push rocks, dig and \nacquire soil samples; a kind of finger that it puts up to measure wind \nspeed and direction; a nose and taste buds, of a sort, with which it \nsenses, to a much higher precision than we can, the presence of trace \nmolec ules; an interior ear with which it can detect the rumbling of \nmarsquakes and the gentler wind -driven jiggling of the spacecraft; and \na means of detecting microbes. The spacecraft has its own self - \ncontained radioactive power source. It radios all the scie ntific \ninformation it acquires back to Earth. It receives instructions from \nEarth, so human beings can ponder the significance of the Viking \nresults and tell the spacecraft to do something new.  \nRut what is the optimum way, given severe constraints on size, cost \nand power requirements, to search for microbes on Mars? We cannot \u2014\nat least as yet \u2014send microbiologists there. I once had a friend, an \nextraordinary microbiologist named Wolf Vishniac, of t he University \nof Rochester, in New York. In the late 1950\u2019s, when we were just \nbeginning to think seriously about looking for life on Mars, he found \nhimself at a scientific meeting where an astronomer expressed \namazement that the biologists had no simple, reliable, automated \ninstrument capable of looking for microorganisms. Vishniac decided \nhe would do something about the matter.  \nHe developed a small device to be sent to the planets. His  \n \n* There was a brief flurry when the uppercase letter B, a putative Martian \ngraffito, seemed to be visible on a small boulder in Chryse. But later \nanalysis showed it to be a trick of light and shadow and the human talent \nfor pattern recognition. It also see ms remarkable that the Martians should \nhave tumbled independently to the Latin alphabet. But there was just a \nmoment when resounding in my head was the distant echo of a word from \nmy boyhood \u2014Barsoom.  \nBlues for a Red Planet  \u2014 226 \nfriends called it the Wolf Trap. It would carry a little vial of  \nnutrient organic matter to Mars, arrange for a sample of Martian soil \nto be mixed in with it, and observe the changing turbidity or \ncloudiness of the liquid as the Martian bugs (if there were any) grew \n(if they would). The Wolf Trap was selected along with  three other \nmicrobiology experiments to go aboard the Viking landers. Two of \nthe other three experiments also chose to send food to the Martians. \nThe success of the Wolf Trap required that Martian bugs like liquid \nwater. There were those who thought that Vishniac would only drown \nthe little Martians. But the advantage of the Wolf Trap was that it laid \nno requirements on what the Martian microbes must do with their \nfood. They had only to grow. All the other experiments made specific \nassumptions about gases that would be given off or taken in by the \nmicrobes, assumptions that were little more than guesses.  \nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which runs \nthe United States planetary space program, is subject to frequent and \nunpredictable budget cuts. Only rarely are there unanticipated budget \nincreases. NASA scientific activities have very little  effective support \nin the government, and so science is most often the target when \nmoney needs to be taken away from NASA. In 1971 it was decided \nthat one of the four microbiology experiments must be removed, and \nthe Wolf Trap was offloaded. It was a crush ing disappointment for \nVishniac, who had invested twelve years in its development.  \nMany others in his place might have stalked off the Viking Biology \nTeam. But Vishniac was a gentle and dedicated man. He decided \ninstead that he could best serve the search for life on Mars by voyaging \nto the most Mars -like environment on Earth \u2014 the dry va lleys of \nAntarctica. Some previous investigators had examined Antarctic soil \nand decided that the few microbes they were able to find were not \nreally natives of the dry valleys, but had been blown there from other, \nmore clement environments. Recalling the Mars Jars experiments, \nVishniac believed that life was tenacious and that Antarctica was \nperfectly consistent with microbiology. If terrestrial bugs could live on \nMars, he thought, why not in Antarctica \u2014which was by and large \nwarmer, wetter, and had more o xygen and much less ultraviolet light. \nConversely, finding life in Antarctic dry valleys would \ncorrespondingly improve, he thought, the chances of life on Mars. \nVishniac believed that the experimental techniques previously used to \ndeduce no indigenous micr obes in Antarctica were flawed. The \nnutrients, while suitable for the comfortable environment of a \nuniversity microbiology laboratory, were not designed for the arid \npolar wasteland.  \nSo on November 8, 1973, Vishniac, his new microbiology \nequipment and a geologist companion were transported by helicopter from McMurdo Station to an area near \nMount Balder, a dry valley in the Asgard \nrange. His practice was to implant the  \n \nThe bland terrain on Chryse Planitia on \nwhich Viking 1 landed.

On December 10, 1973, he left to gather \nsamples on Mount Balder; his departure was photographed from \nabout three kilometers away.

He had wandered into an area not previously explored, had \napparently slipped on the ice and tumbled and bounced for a distance \nof 150 meters.

But the samples that were returned were examined, using \nhis methods, by his professional colleagues and friends. A wide variety \nof microbes, which would have been undetectable with conventional \nscoring techniques, was found in essentially every site examined. A \nnew species of yeas t, apparently unique to Antarctica, was discovered \nin his samples by his widow, Helen Simpson Vishniac. Large rocks \nreturned from Antarctica in that expediti on, examined by Imre \nFriedmann, turn out to have a fascinating microbiology \u2014one or two \nmillimeters inside the rock, algae have colonized a tiny world in which \nsmall quantities of water are trapped and made liquid. On Mars such \na place would be even more in teresting, because while the visible light \nnecessary for photosynthesis would penetrate to that depth, the \ngermicidal ultraviolet light would be at least partially attenuated.  \nBecause the design of space missions is finalized many years before \nlaunch, and because of Vishniac\u2019s death, the results of his Antarctic \nexperiments did not influence the Viking design for seeking Martian \nlife. In general, the microbiology experiments wer e not carried out at \nthe low ambient Martian temperatures, and most did not provide long \nincubation times. They all made fairly strong assumptions about what \nMartian metabolism had to  \nbe like. There was no way to look for life inside the rocks.  \nEach Viking lander was equipped with a sample arm to acquire \nmaterial from the surface and then slowly withdraw it into the innards \nof the spacecraft, transporting the particles on little hoppers like an \nelectric train to five different experiments: one on  the inorganic \nchemistry of the soil, another to look for organic molecules in the sand \nand dust, and three to look for microbial life. When we look for life \non a planet, we are making certain assumptions. We try, as well as we \ncan, not to assume that life  elsewhere will be just like life here. But \nthere are limits to what we can do. We know in detail only about life \n \nhere. While the Viking biology \nexperiments are a pioneering first effort, \nthey hardly represent a definitive search \nfor life on Mars. The results  Blues for a Red Planet  \u2014 229 \nhave been tantalizing, annoying, provocative, stimulating, and, at least \nuntil recently, substantially inconclusive.  \nEach of the three microbiology experiments asked a different kind \nof question, but in all cases a question about Martian metabolism. If \nthere are microorganisms in the Martian soil, they must take in food \nand give off waste gases; or they must take in  \ngases from the atmosphere and, perhaps with the aid of sunlight, \nconvert them into useful materials. So we bring food to Mars and hope \nthat the Martians, if there are any, will find it tasty. Then we see if any \ninteresting new gases come out of the soil. O r we provide our own \nradioactively labeled gases and see if they are converted into organic \nmatter, in which case small Martians are inferred.  \nBy criteria established before launch, two of the three Viking \nmicrobiology experiments seem to have yielded positive results. First, \nwhen Martian soil was mixed with a sterile organic soup from Earth, \nsomething in the soil chemically broke down the soup \u2014almost as if \nthere were respiring microbes metabolizing a food package from Earth. \nSecond, when gases from Earth were introduced into the Martian soil \nsample, the gases became chemically combined with the soil \u2014almost \nas if there were photo - synthesizing mic robes, generating organic \nmatter from atmospheric gases. Positive results in Martian \nmicrobiology were achieved in seven different samplings in two locales \non Mars separated by 5,000 kilometers.  \nBut the situation is complex, and the criteria of experimental \nsuccess may have been inadequate. Enormous efforts were made to \nbuild the Viking microbiology experiments and test them with a \nvariety of microbes. Very little effort was made to calibrate the \nexperiments with plausible inorganic Martian surface materials. Mars \nis not the Earth. As the legacy of Percival Lowell reminds us, we can \nbe fooled. Perhaps there is an exotic inorganic chemistry in the \nMartian soil that is able by itself, in the absence of Martian microbes, \nto oxidize foodstuffs. Perhaps there is some special inorganic, \nnonliving catalyst in the soil that is able to fix atmospheric gases and \nconvert them into organic molecules.  \nRecent experiments suggest that this may indeed be the case. In the \ngreat Martian dust storm of 1971, spectral features of the dust were \nobtained by the Mariner 9 infrared spectrometer. In analyzing these \nspectra, O. B. Toon, J. B. Pollack and I found that  certain features \nseem best accounted for by montmorillonite and other kinds of clay. \nSubsequent observations by the Viking lander support the \nidentification of windblown clays on Mars. Now, A. Banin and J. \nRishpon have found that they can reproduce some o f the key \nfeatures \u2014those resembling photosynthesis as well as those resembling \nrespiration \u2014of the \u201csuccessful\u201d Viking microbiology experiments if in \nlaboratory experiments they sub - stitute such clays for the Martian soil. \nThe clays have a complex active surface, \ngiven to adsorbing and releasing gases \nand to  \n \nWindblown sand and dust in the lee of \nimpact craters in Sinus Meridiani. \nCourtesy NASA.  \n \nWindblown sand and dust in the lee of \nsmall rocks in the Viking 1 landing site.  \nCourtesy NASA.  \n \n126 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe sand -topped boulder known as \u201cBig \nJoe\u201d in Chryse.

It is too soon \nto say that all the Viking microbiology \nresults can be explained by inorganic \nchemistry, but such a result would no \nlonger be surprising. The clay hypothesis \nhardly excludes life on Mars, but it certainly \ncarries us far enough to say that there is no \ncompelling evidence for microbiology on \nMars.  Even so, the results of Banin and Rishpon are of great biological \nimportance because they show that in the absence of life there can be \na kind of soil chemistry that does some of the same things life does. \nOn the Earth before life, there may already have b een chemical \nprocesses resembling respiration and photosynthesis cycling in the \nsoil, perhaps to be incorporated by life once it arose. In addition, we \nknow that montmorillonite clays are a potent catalyst for combining \namino acids into longer chain molecu les resembling proteins. The \nclays of the primitive Earth may have been the forge of life, and the \nchemistry of contemporary Mars may provide essential clues to the \norigin and early history of life on our planet.  \nThe Martian surface exhibits many impact craters, each named after \na person, usually a scientist. Crater Vishniac lies appropriately in the \nAntarctic region of Mars. Vishniac did not claim that there had to be \nlife on Mars, merely that it was possible, and  that it was extraordinarily \nimportant to know if it was there. If life on Mars exists, we will have a \nunique opportunity to test the generality of our form of life. And if \nthere is no life on Mars, a planet rather like the Earth, we must \nunderstand why \u2014because in that case, as Vishniac stressed, we have \nthe classic scientific confrontation of the experiment and the control.  \nThe finding that the Viking microbiology results can be explained \nby clays, that they need not imply life, helps to resolve another mystery: \nthe Viking organic chemistry experiment showed not a hint of organic \nmatter in the Martian soil. If there is life o n Mars, where are the dead \nbodies? No organic molecules could be found \u2014no building blocks of \nproteins and nucleic acids, no simple hydrocarbons, nothing of the \nstuff of life on Earth. This is not necessarily a contradiction, because \nthe Viking microbiology  experiments are a thousand times more \nsensitive (per equivalent carbon atom) than the Viking chemistry \nexperiments, and seem to detect organic matter synthesized in the \nMartian soil. But this does not leave much margin. Terrestrial soil is \nloaded with the  organic remains of once -living organisms; Martian soil \nhas less organic matter than the surface of the Moon. If we held to the \nlife hypothesis, we might suppose that the dead bodies have been \ndestroyed by the chemically reactive, oxidizing surface of Mars \u2014like a \ngerm in a bottle of hydrogen peroxide; or that there is life, but of a \nkind in which organic chemistry plays a less central role than it does \nin life on Earth.  \nBut this last alternative seems to me to be special pleading: I am, \nreluctantly, a self -confessed carbon chauvinist. Carbon is  \nBlues for a Red Planet  \u2014 231 \nThe Viking Lander, in simulation in \nDeath Valley, California. Between the \ntwo turrets containing the television \ncam- \neras is the magazine holding the still -  \nunfurled sample arm.  \nabundant in the Cosmos. It makes marvelously complex molecules, \ngood for life. I am also a water chauvinist. Water makes an ideal \nsolvent system for organic chemistry to work in and stays liquid over \na wide range of temperatures. But sometimes I wonder. Co uld my \nfondness for these materials have something to do with the fact that I \nam made chiefly of them? Are we carbon - and water -based because \nthose materials were abundant on the Earth at the time of the origin \nof life? Could life elsewhere \u2014on Mars,  \nsay\u2014be built of different stuff?  \nI am a collection of water, calcium and organic molecules called \nCarl Sagan. You are a collection of almost identical molecules with a \ndifferent collective label. But is that all? Is there nothing in here but \nmolecules? Some people find this idea somehow d emeaning to human \ndignity. For myself, I find it elevating that our universe permits the \nevolution of molecular machines as intricate and subtle as we.  \nBut the essence of life is not so much the atoms and simple \nmolecules that make us up as the way in which they are put together. \nBlues for a Red Planet  \u2014 232 \nEvery now and then we read that the chemicals which constitute the \nhuman body cost ninety -seven cents or ten dollars or some such figure; \nit is a little depressing to find our bodies valued so little. However, \nthese estimates are for human beings reduced t o our simplest possible \ncomponents. We are made   \n128 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe North Polar Cap of Mars, surrounded by \ndark sand dune fields. This cap is made \nprimarily of water ice; the South Polar Cap, \nmainly of frozen carbon dioxide.

Courtesy NASA.  \nmostly of water, which costs almost \nnothing; the carbon is costed in the form \nof coal; the calcium in our bones as chalk; \nthe nitrogen in our proteins as air (cheap also); the iron in our blood as rusty nails. If we did not know better, \nwe might be tempted to take all the atoms that make us up, mix them \ntogether in a big container and stir. We can do this as much as we \nwant. But in the end all we have is a tedious mix ture of atoms. How \ncould we have expected anything else?  \nHarold Morowitz has calculated what it would cost to put together \nthe correct molecular  constituents that make up a human being by \nbuying the molecules from chemical supply houses. The answer turns \nout to be about ten million dollars, which should make us all feel a \nlittle better. But even then we could not mix those chemicals together \nand h ave a human being emerge from the jar. That is far beyond our \ncapability and will probably be so for a very long period of time. \nFortunately, there are other less expens ive but still highly reliable \nmethods of making human beings.  \nI think the lifeforms on many worlds will consist, by and large, of \nthe same atoms we have here, perhaps even many of the same basic \nmolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids \u2014but put together in \nunfamiliar ways. Perhaps organisms that float in dense pl anetary \natmospheres will be very much like us in their atomic composition, \nexcept they might not have bones and therefore not need much \ncalcium. Perhaps elsewhere some solvent other than water is used. \nHydrofluoric acid might serve rather well, although th ere is not a great \ndeal of fluorine in the Cosmos; hydrofluoric acid would do a great \ndeal of damage to the kind of molecules that make us up, but other \norganic molecules, paraffin waxes, for example, are perfectly stable in \nits presence. Liquid ammonia wo uld make an even better solvent \nsystem, because ammonia is very abundant in the Cosmos. But it is \nliquid only on worlds much colder than the Earth or Mars. Ammonia \nis ordinarily a gas on Earth, as water is on Venus. Or perhaps there \nare living things that do not have a solvent system at all \u2014solid -state \nlife, where there are electrical signals propagating rather than \nmolecules floating about.  \nBut these ideas do not rescue the notion that the Viking lander \nexperiments indicate life on Mars. On that rather Earth -like world, \nwith abundant carbon and water, life, if it exists, should be based on \norganic chemistry. The organic chemistry results, lik e the imaging and \nmicrobiology results, are all consistent with no life in the fine particles \nof Chryse and Utopia in the late  \n1970\u2019s. Perhaps some millimeters beneath the rocks (as in the \nAntarctic dry valleys), or elsewhere on the planet, or in some earlier, \nmore clement time. But not where and when we looked.  \nThe Viking exploration of Mars is a mission of major historical \nimportance, the first serious search for what other kinds of life may \nbe, the first survival of a functioning spacecraft for more  \nBlues for a Red Planet \u2014 234 \nthan an hour or so on any other planet (Viking 1 has survived for \nyears), the source of a rich harvest of data on the geology,  \nseismology, mineralogy, meteorology and half a dozen other sciences \nof another world. How should we follow up on these spectacular \nadvances? Some scientists want to send an automatic device that would \nland, acquire soil samples, and return them to Earth, w here they could \nbe examined in great detail in the large sophisticated laboratories of \nEarth rather than in the limited microminiaturized laboratories that \nwe are able to send to Mars. In this way most of the ambiguities of the \nViking microbiology experime nts could be resolved. The chemistry \nand mineralogy of the soil could be determined; rocks could be broken \nopen to search for subsurface life; hundreds of tests for organic \nchemistry and life could be performed, including direct microscopic \nexamination, un der a wide range of conditions. We could even use \nVishniac\u2019s scoring techniques. Although it would be fairly expensive, \nsuch a mission is probably within our technological capability.  \nHowever, it carries with it a novel danger: back -contamina - tion. If \nwe wish on Earth to examine samples of Martian soil for microbes, we \nmust, of course, not sterilize the samples beforehand. The point of the \nexpedition is to bring them back alive. But wh at then? Might Martian \nmicroorganisms returned to Earth pose a public health hazard? The \nMartians of H. G. Wells and Orson Welles, preoccupied with the \nsuppression of Bournemouth and Jersey City, never noticed until too \nlate that their immunological defens es were unavailing against the \nmicrobes of Earth. Is the converse possible? This is a serious and \ndifficult issue. There may be no micromartians. If they exist, perhaps \nwe can eat a kilogram of them with no ill effects. But we are not sure, \nand the stakes are high. If we wish to return unsterilized Martian \nsamples to Earth, we must have a containment procedure that is \nstupefyingly reliable. There are nations that develop and stockpile \nbacteriological weapons. They seem to have an occasional accident, \nbut th ey have not yet, so far as I know, produced global pandemics. \nPerhaps Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth. But I would \nwant to be very sure before considering a retumed -sample mission.  \nThere is another way to investigate Mars and the full range of \ndelights and discoveries this heterogeneous planet holds for us. My \nmost persistent emotion in working with the Viking lander pictures \nwas frustration at our immobility. I found myself unconsci ously urging \nthe spacecraft at least to stand on its tiptoes, as if this laboratory, \ndesigned for immobility, were perversely refusing to manage even a \nlittle hop. How we longed to poke that dune with the sample arm, \nlook for life beneath that rock, see if  that distant ridge was a crater \nrampart. And not so very far to the southeast, I knew, were the four \nsinuous channels of Chryse.

I know a hundred places on Mars which are far more interesting than \nour landing sites. The ideal tool is a roving vehicle carrying on \nadvanced experiments, particularly in imaging, chemistry and biology. \nPrototypes of such rovers are under development by N ASA. They \nknow on their own how to go over rocks, how not to fall down ravines, \nhow to get out of tight spots. It is within our capability to land a rover \non Mars that could scan its surroundings, see the most interesting \nplace in its field of view and, by  the same time tomorrow, be there. \nEvery day a new place, a complex, winding traverse over the varied \ntopography of this appealing planet.  \nSuch a mission would reap enormous scientific benefits, even if \nthere is no life on Mars. We could wander down the ancient river \nvalleys, up the slopes of one of the great volcanic mountains, along the \nstrange stepped terrain of the icy polar terraces, or muster a close \napproach to the beckoning pyramids of Mars.* Public interest in such \na mission would be sizable. Every day a new set of vistas would arrive \non our home television screens. We could trace the route, ponder the \nfindings, suggest new destinatio ns. The journey would be long, the \nrover obedient to radio commands from Earth. There would be plenty \nof time for good new ideas to be incorporated into the mission plan. \nA billion people could participate in the exploration of another world.  \nThe surface area of Mars is exactly as large as the land area of the \nEarth. A thorough reconnaissance will clearly occupy us for centuries. \nBut there will be a time when Mars is all explored; a time after robot \naircraft have mapped it from aloft, a time af ter rovers have combed the \nsurface, a time after samples have been returned safely to Earth, a time \nafter human beings have walked the sands of Mars. What then? What \nshall we do with Mars?  \nThere are so many examples of human misuse of the Earth that even \nphrasing this question chills me. If there is life on Mars, I believe we \nshould do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even \nif the Martians are only microbes. The existence  of an independent \nbiology on a nearby planet is a treasure beyond assessing, and the \npreservation of that life must, I think, supersede any other possible use \nof Mars. However, suppose Mars is lifeless. It is not a plausible source \nof raw materials: the f reightage from Mars to Earth would be too \nexpensive for many centuries to come. But might we be able to live on \nMars? Could we in some sense make Mars habitable?  \nA lovely world, surely, but there is \u2014from our parochial point of \nview\u2014much wrong with Mars, chiefly the low oxygen abundance, the \nabsence of liquid water, and the high ultraviolet flux.  \n \n* The largest are 3 kilometers across at the base, and 1 kilometer high - much \nlarger than the pyramids of Sumer, Egypt or Mexico on Earth. They seem \n \neroded and ancient, and are, perhaps, only small \nmountains, sandblasted for ages. But they \nwarrant, I think, a careful look.

All of these \nproblems could be solved if we could make more air. With higher \natmospheric pressures, liquid water would be possible.  With more \noxygen we might breathe the atmosphere, and ozone would form to \nshield the surface from solar ultraviolet radiation. The sinuous \nchannels, stacked polar plates and other evidence suggest that Mars once had such a denser atmosphere. \nThose gases a re unlikely to have escaped \nfrom Mars.

But most \nmay be in the present polar ice caps.  \nTo vaporize the caps, we must heat them; \nperhaps we could dust them with a dark \npowder, heating them by absorbing more \nsunlight, the opposite of what we do to the \nEarth when we destroy forests and grasslands. But the surface area of the caps is very large. The necessary \ndust would require 1,200 Saturn 5 rocket boosters to be transported \nfrom Earth to Mars; even then, the winds might blow the dust off the \npolar caps. A better way would be to devise some dark material able to \nmake copies of itself, a little d usky machine which we deliver to Mars \nand which then goes about reproducing itself from indigenous \nmaterials all over the polar caps. There is a category of such machines. \nWe call them plants. Some are very hardy and resilient. We know that \nat least some t errestrial microbes can survive on Mars. What is \nnecessary is a program of artificial selection and genetic engineering of \ndark plants \u2014perhaps lichens \u2014that could survive the much more severe \nMartian environment. If such plants could be bred, we might imagi ne \nthem being seeded on the vast expanse of the Martian polar ice caps, \ntaking root, spreading, blackening the ice caps, absorbing sunlight, \nheating the ice, and releasing the  \nBlues for a Red Planet \u2014 241 \nancient Martian atmosphere from its long captivity. We might even \nimagine a kind of Martian Johnny Appleseed, robot or human, \nroaming the frozen polar wastes in an endeavor that benefits only the \ngenerations of humans to come.  \nThis general concept is called terraforming: the changing of an alien \nlandscape into one more suitable for human beings. In thousands of \nyears humans have managed to perturb the global temperature of the \nEarth by only about one degree through greenhouse an d albedo \nchanges, although at the present rate of burning fossil fuels and \ndestroying forests and grasslands we can now charge the global \ntemperature by another degree in only a century or two. These and \nother considerations suggest that a time scale for a  significant \nterraforming of Mars is probably hundreds  Trenches dug in Chryse in the search for life \non Mars (top).

In a future time of greatly advanced technology \nwe might wish not only to increase the total atmospheric pressure and \nmake liquid water possible but also to carry liquid water from the melting polar caps to the warmer \nequatorial regions. There is, of course, a \nway to do it. We would build canals.  \nThe melting surface and subsurface ice \nwould be transported by a great canal \nnetwork. But this is precisely what \nPercival Lowell, not a hundred years ago, \nmistakenly proposed was in fact \nhappening on Mars.

If only a network of canals existed, the lack \nwould be remedied, the habitability of Mars would become plausible. \nLowell\u2019s observations were made under extremely  difficult seeing  Blues for a Red Planet \u2014 244 \nconditions. Others, like Schiaparelli, had already observed something \nlike the canals; they were called canali  before Lowell began his lifelong \nlove affair with Mars.

His canal network was built by Martians. Even  \nthis may be an accurate prophecy: If the planet ever is terra - formed, \nit will be done by human beings whose permanent residence and \nplanetary affiliation is Mars.

They are \nbeautifully constructed, semi -intelligent \nrobots exploring unknown worlds. Voyages \nto the outer solar system are controlled \nfrom  a single place on the planet Earth, the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the \nNational Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration in Pasadena, California.  \nOn July 9, 1979, a spacecraft called \nVoyager 2 encountered the Jupiter system. \nIt had been almost two years sailing through \ninterplanetary space. The ship is made of millions of separate parts assembled redundantly, so that if some \ncomponent fails, others will take over its responsibilities. The \nspacecraft weighs 0.9 tons and would fill a large living room. Its \nmission takes it so far from the Sun that it cannot be powered by solar \nenergy, as other spacecraft are. Instead, Voyager re lies on a small \nnuclear power plant, drawing hundreds of watts from the radioactive \ndecay of a pellet of plutonium. Its three integrated computers and \nmost of its housekeeping functions \u2014for example, its tempera - ture-\ncontrol system \u2014are localized in its middle. It receives command s from \nEarth and radios its findings back to Earth through a large antenna, \n3.7 meters in diameter. Most of its scientific instruments are on a scan \nplatform, which tracks Jupiter or one of its moons as the spacecraft \nhurtles past. There are many scientifi c instruments \u2014ultraviolet and \ninfrared spectrometers, devices to measure charged particles and \nmagnetic fields and the radio emission from Jupiter \u2014but the most \nproductive have been the two television cameras, designed to take tens \nof thousands of pictures of the planetary islands in the outer solar \nsystem.  \nJupiter is surrounded by a shell of invisible but extremely dangerous \nhigh-energy charged particles. The spacecraft must pass through the \nouter edge of this radiation belt to examine  \n \nTravelers\u2019 Tales \u2014 139 \nJupiter and its moons close up, and to continue its mission to  \nSaturn and beyond. But the charged particles can damage the delicate \ninstruments and fry the electronics. Jupiter is also surrounded by a \nring of solid debris, discovered four months earlier by Voyager 1, \nwhich Voyager 2 had to traverse. A collision with a  small boulder \ncould have sent the spacecraft tumbling wildly out of control, its \nantenna unable to lock on the Earth, its data lost forever. Just before \nEncounter, the mission controllers were restive. There were some \nalarms and emergencies, but the combi ned intelligence of the humans \non Earth and the robot in space circumvented disaster.  \nLaunched on August 20, 1977, it moved on an arcing trajectory \npast the orbit of Mars, through the asteroid belt, to approach the \nJupiter system and thread its way past the planet and among its \nfourteen or so moons. Voyagers passage by Jupiter accelerated i t \ntoward a close encounter with Saturn. Saturn\u2019s gravity will propel it \non to Uranus. After Uranus it will plunge on past Neptune, leaving \nthe solar system, becoming an interstellar spacecraft, fated to roam \nforever the great ocean between the stars.  \nThese voyages of exploration and discovery are the latest in a long \nseries that have characterized and distinguished human history. In the \nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries you could travel from Spain to the \nAzores in a few days, the same time it takes us now to cross the channel \nfrom the Earth to the Moon. It took then a few months to traverse the \nAtlantic Ocean and reach what was called the New World, the \nAmericas. Today it takes a few months to cross the ocean of the inner \nsolar system and make planet -fall on Mars or Venus, which are truly \nand literally new worlds awaiting us. In the seventeenth and \neighteenth centuries you could travel from Holland to China in a year \nor two, the time it has taken Voyager to travel from Earth to Jupiter.* \nThe annual costs  were, relatively, more then than now, but in both  \ncases less than 1 percent of the appropriate Gross National Product. \nOur present spaceships, with their robot crews, are the harbingers, the \nvanguards of future human expeditions to the planets. We have \ntraveled this way before.  \nThe fifteenth through seventeenth centuries represent a major \nturning point in our history. It then became clear that we could \nventure to all parts of our planet. Plucky sailing vessels from half a \ndozen European nations dispersed to every ocean. There wer e many \nmotivations for these journeys: ambition, greed, national pride, \nreligious fanaticism, prison pardons, scientific curiosity, the  \n \nMission Control at the Jet Propulsion \nLaboratory, NASA.  \n* Or, to make a different comparison, a fertilized egg takes as long to \nwander from the fallopian tubes and implant itself in the uterus as Apollo \n11 took to journey to the Moon; and as long to develop into a full -term \n \ninfant as Viking took on its trip to Mars.

It was a rational, orderly, creative society. \nBut because Spanish ports and vessels were closed to Dutch shipping, \nthe economic survival of the tiny republic depended on its ability to \nconstruct, man and deploy a  \ngreat fleet of commercial sailing vessels.  \nThe Dutch East India Company, a joint governmental and private \nenterprise, sent ships to the far corners of the world to acquire rare \ncommodities and resell them at a profit in Europe. Such voyages were \nthe life blood of the Republic. Navigational charts a nd maps were \nclassified as state secrets. Ships often embarked with sealed orders. \nSuddenly the Dutch were present all over the planet. The Barents Sea \nin the Arctic Ocean and Tasmania in Australia are named after Dutch \nsea captains. These expeditions were  not merely commercial \nexploitations, although there was plenty of that. There were powerful \nelements of scientific adventure and the zest for discovery of new \nlands, new plants and animals, new people; the pursuit of knowledge \nfor its own sake.  \nThe Amsterdam Town Hall reflects the confident and secular self -\nimage of seventeenth -century Holland. It took shiploads of marble to \nbuild. Constantijn Huygens, a poet and diplomat of the time, \n \nremarked that the Town Hall dispelled \n\u201cthe Gothic squint and squalor.\u201d In the \nTown Hall to this day, there is a   \nstatue of Atlas supporting the heavens, festooned with constellations. \nBeneath is Justice, brandishing a golden sword and scales, standing \nbetween Death and Punishment, and treading underfoot Avarice and \nEnvy, the gods of the merchants. The Dutch, whose ec onomy was \nbased on private profit, nevertheless understood that the unrestrained \npursuit of profit posed a threat to the nation\u2019s soul.  \nA less allegorical symbol may be found under Atlas and Justice, on \nthe floor of the Town Hall. It is a great inlaid map, dating from the \nlate seventeenth or early eighteenth centuries, reaching from West \nAfrica to the Pacific Ocean. The whole world was Hol land\u2019s arena. \nAnd on this map, with disarming modesty the Dutch omitted \nthemselves, using only the old Latin name Belgium for their part of \nEurope.  \nIn a typical year many ships set sail halfway around the world.  \nDown the west coast of Africa, through what they called the  \nEthiopian Sea, around the south coast of Africa, within the  \nStraits of Madagascar, and on past the southern tip of India they \nsailed, to one major focus of their interests, the Spice Islands, present -\nday Indonesia. Some expeditions journeyed from there to a land \nnamed New Holland, and today called Australia. A few ventured \nthrough the Straits of Malacca, past the Philippines, to China. We \nknow from a mid -seventeenth -century account of an  \n\u201cEmbassy from the East India Company of the United Provinces of \nthe Netherlands, to the Grand Tartar, Cham, Emperor of China.\u201d The \nDutch burgers, ambassadors and sea captains stood wide -eyed in \namazement, face to face with another civilization in the Imper ial City \nof Peking.*  \nNever before or since has Holland been the world power it was \nthen. A small country, forced to live by its wits, its foreign policy \ncontained a strong pacifist element. Because of its tolerance for \nunorthodox opinions, it was a haven for intellectuals who were \nrefugees from censorship and thought control elsewhere in Europe \u2014\nmuch as the United States benefited enormously in the  \n1930\u2019s by the exodus of intellectuals from Nazi -dominated Europe. So \nseventeenth -century Holland was the home of the great Jewish \nphilosopher Spinoza, whom Einstein admired; of Descartes, a pivotal \nfigure in the history of mathematics and philosophy; and o f John \nLocke, a political scientist who influenced a group of philosophically \ninclined revolutionaries named Paine, Hamilton, Adams, Franklin \nand Jefferson. Never before or since has Holland been graced by such \na galaxy of artists and scientists, philosop hers and mathematicians. \nThis was the time of the master painters Rembrandt and Vermeer and  \nFrans Hals; of Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope; of  * We even know what gifts they brought \nthe Court.

In this paint - \ning by Jean -Leon Huens, Galileo is at-  \ntempting to convince skeptical ecclesiastics \nthat there are mountains on the Moon and \nthat the planet Jupiter possesses several \nmoons of its own. The Catholic hierarchy \nremained unconvinced. In 1633 Galileo \nwas compelled to stand trial for \u201cvehement \nsuspic ion of  \nheresy.\u201d Convicted on the evidence of a \nforged document, Galileo spent the last \neight years of his life under house arrest in \nhis small house outside Florence.

With it he discovered \nsunspots, the phases of Venus, the craters of the Moon, and the four \nlarge moons of Jupiter now called, after him, the Galilean satellites. \nGalileo\u2019s own description of his ecclesiastical trava ils is contained in a \nletter he wrote in the year 1615 to the Grand Duchess Christina:  \nSome years ago as Your Serene Highness well knows, I \ndiscovered in the heavens many things that had not been seen \nbefore our own age. The novelty of these things, as well as some \nconsequences which followed from them in contradiction to the \nphysical notion s commonly held among academic philosophers, \nstirred up against me no small number of professors [many of \nthem ecclesiastics] \u2014as if I had placed these things in the sky with \nmy own hands in order to upset Nature and overturn the \nsciences. They  \nseemed to forget that the increase of known truths stimu-  \nlates the investigation, establishment, and growth of the arts.5 \nThe connection between Holland as an exploratory power and \nHolland as an intellectual and cultural center was very strong. The \n \n5  The courage of Galileo (and Kepler) in promoting the heliocentric \nhypothesis was not evident in the actions of others, even those residing in less \nfanatically doctrinal parts of Europe. For example, in a letter dated April \n1634, Rene Descartes, then livin g in Holland, wrote:  \nDoubtless you know that Galileo was recently censured by the \nInquisitors of the Faith, and that his views about the movement of the \nEarth were condemned as heretical. I must tell you that all the things I \nexplained in my treatise, which included the doctri ne of the movement \nof the Earth, were so interdependent that it is enough to discover that \none of them is false to know that all the arguments I was using are \nunsound. Though I thought they were  \nbased on very certain and evident proofs, I would not wish, for anything \nin the world, to maintain them against the authority of the Church. . . \n. I desire to live in peace and to continue the life I have begun under \nthe motto to live well you must live unseen.   \nimprovement of sailing ships encouraged technology of all kinds. \nPeople enjoyed working with their hands. Inventions were prized. \nTechnological advance required the freest possible pursuit  \n \n* In 1979 Pope John Paul II cautiously proposed reversing the condemnation \nof Galileo done 346 years earlier by the \u201cHoly Inquisition.\u201d  \n \nTravelers\u2019 Tales  \u2014 143 \nof knowledge, so Holland became the leading publisher and  \nbookseller in Europe, translating works written in other languages and \npermitting the publication of works proscribed elsewhere. Adventures \ninto exotic lands and encounters with strange societies shook \ncomplacency, challenged thinkers to reconsider the pre vailing wisdom \nand showed that ideas that had been accepted for thousands of years \u2014\nfor example, on geography \u2014 were fundamentally in error. In a time \nwhen kings and emperors ruled much of the world, the Dutch \nRepublic was governed, more than any other natio n, by the people. \nThe openness of the society and its encouragement of the life of the \nmind, its material well -being and its commitment to the exploration \nand utilization  \nof new worlds generated a joyful confidence in the human enterprise.*  \nIn Italy, Galileo had announced other worlds, and Giordano Bruno \nhad speculated on other lifeforms. For this they had been made to \nsuffer brutally. But in Holland, the astronomer Christiaan Huygens, \nwho believed in both, was showered with honors. His fathe r was \nConstantijn Huygens, a master diplomat of the age, a litterateur, poet, \ncomposer, musician, close friend and translator of the English poet \nJohn Donne, and the head of an archetypical great family. Constantijn \nadmired the painter Rubens, and \u201cdiscove red\u201d a young artist named \nRembrandt van  \nRijn, in several of whose works he subsequently appears. After their \nfirst meeting, Descartes wrote of him: \u201cI could not believe that a single \nmind could occupy itself with so many things, and equip itself so well \nin all of them.\u201d The Huygens home was fill ed with goods from all over \nthe world. Distinguished thinkers from other nations were frequent \nguests. Growing up in this environment, the young Christiaan \nHuygens became simultaneously adept in languages, drawing, law, \nscience, engineering, mathematics an d music. His interests and \nallegiances were broad. \u201cThe world is my country,\u201d he said, \u201cscience \nmy religion.\u201d  \nLight was a motif of the age: the symbolic enlightenment of freedom \nof thought and religion, of geographical discovery; the light that \npermeated the paintings of the time, particularly the exquisite work of \nVermeer; and light as an object of scientific inq uiry, as in Snell\u2019s study \nof refraction, Leeuwenhoek\u2019s invention of the microscope and \nHuygens\u2019 own wave theory of light.6 \n \n \n6  Isaac Newton admired Christiaan Huygens and thought him \u201cthe most \nelegant mathematician\u201d of their time, and the truest follower of the  * This exploratory tradition may account for \nthe fact that Holland has, to this day, \nproduced far more than its per capita share \nof distinguished astronomers, among them \nGerard Peter Kuiper, who in the 1940\u2019s and \n1950\u2019s was the world\u2019s only full -time \nplane tary astrophysicist. The subject was \nthen considered by most professional \nastronomers to be at least slightly \ndisreputable, tainted with Lowellian \nexcesses.

Courtesy \nHuygensmuseum \u201cHofwijck,\u201d Voorburg, \nHolland.  \n257  \n\u2014 Cosmos  \n \nA detail from the notebooks of Christiaan  \nHuygens, recording his observations, with \none of Leeuwenhoeks microscopes, of \nspermatazoa from the seminal fluids of a \ndog (left) and a man.  \nThese were all connected activities, and \ntheir practitioners mingled freely. \nVermeer\u2019s interiors are characteristically \ntilled with nautical artifacts and wall \nmaps. Microscopes were drawing -room \ncuriosities. Leeuwenhoek was the \nexecutor of Vermeer\u2019s estat e and a \nfrequent visitor at the Huygens home in \nHofwijck.  \nLeeuwenhoek\u2019s microscope evolved \nfrom the magnifying glasses employed by \ndrapers to examine the quality of cloth. \nWith it he discovered a universe in a \ndrop of water: the microbes, which he \ndescribed as \u201canimalcules\u201d and thought \n\u201ccute.\u201d Huygens had contrib uted to the \ndesign of the first microscopes and \nhimself made many discoveries with \nthem. Leeuwenhoek and Huygens were \namong the first people ever to see human sperm cells, a prerequisite for understanding human reproduction. To \nexplain how microorganisms s lowly develop in water previously \nsterilized by boiling, Huygens proposed that they were small enough to \nfloat through the air and reproduced on alighting in water. Thus he \nestablished an alternative to spontaneous generation \u2014the notion that \nlife could ari se, in fermenting grape juice or rotting meat, entirely \nindependent of preexisting life. It was not until the time of Louis \nPasteur, two centuries later, that Huygens\u2019 speculation was proved \ncorrect. The Viking search for life on Mars can be traced in more  ways \nthan one back to Leeuwenhoek and Huygens. They are also the \ngrandfathers of the germ theory of disease, and therefore of much of \nmodern medicine. But they had no practical motives in mind. They \nwere merely tinkering in a technological society.  \nThe microscope and telescope, both developed in early seventeenth -\ncentury Holland, represent an extension of human vision to the \nrealms of the very small and the very large. Our observations of atoms \nand galaxies were launched in this time and place. Chris tiaan Huygens \nloved to grind and polish lenses for astronomical telescopes and \nconstructed one five meters long.  \n \nmathematical tradition of the ancient Greeks \u2014then, as now, a great \ncompliment. Newton believed, in part because shadows had sharp edges, \nthat light behaved as if it were a stream of tiny particles. He thought that \nred light was composed of the largest part icles and violet the smallest. \nHuygens argued that instead light behaved as if it were a wave propagating \nin a vacuum, as an ocean wave does in the sea \u2014which is why we talk about \nthe wavelength and frequency of light. Many properties of light, including \ndiffraction, are naturally explained by the wave theory, and in subsequent \nyears Huygens\u2019 view carried the day. But in 1905, Einstein showed that the \nparticle theory of light could explain the photoelectric effect, the ejection \nof electrons from a metal upon  exposure to a beam of light. Modern \nquantum mechanics combines both ideas, and it is customary today to \nthink of light as behaving in some circumstances as a beam of particles and \nin others as a wave. This wave -particle dualism may not correspond readily \nto our common -sense notions, but it is in excellent accord with what \nexperiments have shown light really does. There is something mysterious \nand stirring in this marriage of opposites, and it is fitting that Newton and \nHuygens, bachelors both, were the par ents of our modern understanding \nof the nature of light.  \n \nTravelers\u2019 Tales \u2014 145 \nHis discoveries with the telescope would by themselves have  \nensured his place in the history of human accomplishment. In the \nfootsteps of Eratosthenes, he was the first person to measure the size \nof another planet. He was also the first to speculate that Venus is \ncompletely covered with clouds; the first to draw a surface feature on \nthe planet Mars (a vast dark windswept slope called Syrtis Major); and \nby observing the appearance and disappearance of such features as \nthe planet rotated, the first to determine that the Martian day was, \nlike ours, roughly twenty -four hours long. He was the first to recognize \nthat Saturn was surrounded by a system of rings which nowhere \ntouches the planet.* And he was the discoverer of Titan, the largest \nmoon of Saturn and, as we now know, the second largest moon in \nthe solar system \u2014a world of extraordinary interest and promise. Most \nof these discoveries he made in his twenties. He also thought astrology \nwas nonsense.  \nHuygens did much more. A key problem for marine navigation in \nthis age was the determination of longitude. Latitude could easily be \ndetermined by the stars \u2014the farther south you were, the more \nsouthern constellations you could see. But longitude required p recise \ntimekeeping. An accurate shipboard clock would tell the time in your \nhome port; the rising and setting of the Sun and stars would specify \nthe local shipboard time; and the difference between the two would \nyield your longitude. Huygens invented the p endulum clock (its \nprinciple had been discovered earlier by Galileo), which was then \nemployed, although not fully successfully, to calculate position in the \nmidst of the great ocean. His efforts introduced an unprecedented \naccuracy in astronomical and othe r scientific observations and \nstimulated further advances in nautical clocks. He invented the spiral \nbalance spring still used in some watches today; made fundamental \ncontributions to mechanics \u2014e.g., the calculation of centrifugal force \u2014 \nand, from a study of the game of dice, to the theory of probability. He \nimproved the air pump, which was later to revolutionize the mining \nindustry, and the \u201cmagic lantern,\u201d the ancestor of the slide projector. \nHe also invented something called the \u201cgunpowder engine,\u201d which  \ninfluenced the development of another machine, the steam engine.  Huygens was delighted that the \nCopemican view of the Earth as a planet \nin motion around the Sun was widely \naccepted even by the ordinary people in \nHolland. Indeed, he said, Copernicus was \nacknowledged by all astronomers except \nthose who \u201cwere a bit slow -witted or \nunder the superstitions imposed by \nmerely human authority.\u201d In the Middle \nAges, Christian philosophers were fond \nof arguing that, since the heavens circle \nthe Earth once  \n \nA detail from Christiaan Huygens\u2019 Sys- tema \nSaturnium,  published in 1659. Shown is his \n(correct) explanation of the changing \nappearance of the rings of Saturn over the \nyears as the relative geometry of Earth and \nSaturn changes. In position B the \ncomparatively paper -thin rings disappear as \nthey are seen edge -on. In position A they \ndisplay their maximum extent visible from \nEarth, the configuration that caused \nGalileo, with a significantly inferior \ntelescope, considerable consternation.  \n*Galileo discovered the rings, but had no idea what to make of them. \nThrough his early astronomical telescope, they seemed to be two \nprojections symmetrically attached to Saturn, resembling, he said in some \nbafflement, ears.  \n259  \n \u2014 Cosmos  \nevery day, they can hardly be infinite in extent; and therefore an \ninfinite number of worlds, or even a large number of them (or even \none other of them), is impossible. The discovery that the Earth is \nturning rather than the sky moving had important implic ations for \nthe uniqueness of the Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. \nCopernicus held that not just the solar system but the entire universe \nwas heliocentric, and Kepler denied that the stars have planetary \nsystems. The first person to make explici t the idea of a large \u2014indeed, \nan infinite \u2014number of other worlds in orbit about other suns seems \nto have been Giordano Bruno. But others thought that the plurality \nof worlds followed immediately from the ideas of Copernicus and \nKepler and found themselves aghast. In the early seventeenth century, \nRobert Merton contended that the heliocentric hypothesis implied a \nmultitude of other planetary systems, and that this was an argument \nof the sort called reductio ad absurdum (Appendix 1), demonstrating \nthe error o f the initial assumption. He wrote, in an argument which \nmay once have seemed withering,  \nFor if the firmament be of such an incomparable bigness, as \nthese Copemical giants will have i t . . . , so vast and full of \ninnumerable stars, as being infinite in extent . . . why may we \nnot suppose . . . those infinite stars visible in the firmament to \nbe so many suns, with particular fixed centers; to have likewise \ntheir subordinate planets, as the sun hath his dancing still \naround him?. . . And so, in consequence, there are infinite \nhabitable worlds; what hinders? . . . these and suchlike insolent \nand bold attempts, prodigious paradoxes, inferences must needs \nfollow, if it once be granted which . . . Kepler . . . and others \nmaintain of the Earth\u2019s motion.  \nBut the Earth does move. Merton, if he lived today, would be \nobliged to deduce \u201cinfinite, habitable worlds.\u201d Huygens did not shrink \nfrom this conclusion; he embraced it gladly: Across the sea of space \nthe stars are other suns. By analogy with our solar sys tem, Huygens \nreasoned that those stars should have their own planetary systems and \nthat many of these planets might be inhabited: \u201cShould we allow the \nplanets nothing but vast deserts . . . and deprive them of all those \ncreatures that more plainly bespeak their divine architect, we should \nsink them below the  \nEarth in beauty and dignity, a thing very unreasonable.\u201d*  \nThese ideas were set forth in an extraordinary book bearing the \ntriumphant title The Celestial Worlds Discover\u2019d: Conjectures  Concerning \nthe Inhabitants, Plants and Productions of the Worlds  in the Planets . 260  \nComposed shortly before Huygens died in 1690, the work was \nadmired by many, including Czar Peter the Great,  \n \n* A few others had held similar opinions. In his Harmonice Mundi  Kepler \nremarked \u201cit was Tycho Brahe\u2019s opinion concerning that bare wilderness \nof globes that it does not exist fruitlessly but is filled with inhabitants.\u201d  \n \nwho made it the first product of Western science to be published in \nRussia. The book is in large part about the nature or environments of \nthe planets. Among the figures in the finely rendered first edition is \none in which we see, to scale, the Sun and the giant planets Jupiter \nand Saturn. They are, comparatively, rather small. There is also an \netching of Saturn next to the Earth: Our planet is a tiny circle.  \nBy and large Huygens imagined the environments and inhabitants \nof other planets to be rather like those of seventeenth - century Earth. \nHe conceived of \u201cplanetarians\u201d whose \u201cwhole Bodies, and every part \nof them, may be quite distinct and different from ours  . . . \u2019tis a very \nridiculous opinion . . . that it is impossible a rational Soul should dwell \nin any other shape than ours.\u201d You could be smart, he was saying, even \nif you looked peculiar. But he then went on to argue that they would \nnot look very peculia r\u2014that they must have hands and feet and walk \nupright, that they would have writing and geometry, and that Jupiter \nhas its four Galilean satellites to provide a navigational aid for the \nsailors in the Jovian oceans. Huygens was, of course, a citizen of his  \ntime. Who of us is not? He claimed science as his religion and then \nargued that the planets must be inhabited because otherwise God had \nmade worlds for nothing. Because he lived before Darwin, his \nspeculations about extraterrestrial life are innocent of t he evolutionary \nperspective. But he was able to develop on observational grounds \nsomething akin to the modern cosmic perspective:  \nWhat a wonderful and Amazing scheme have we here of the \nmagnificant vastness of the universe ... So many Suns, so many \nEarths . . . and every one of them stock\u2019d with so many Herbs, \nTrees, and Animals, adorn\u2019d with so many Seas and Mountains! \n. . . And how  must our Wonder and  \nAdmiration be increased when we consider the prodigious Distance \nand Multitude of the Stars.  \nThe Voyager spacecraft are the lineal descendants of those sailing -\nship voyages of exploration, and of the scientific and speculative \ntradition of Christiaan Huygens. The Voyagers are caravels bound for \nthe stars, and on the way exploring those worlds that  Huygens knew \nand loved so well.  \nOne of the main commodities returned on those voyages of \ncenturies ago were travelers\u2019 tales,* stories of alien lands and exotic \ncreatures that evoked our sense of wonder and stimulated future \nexploration. There had been accounts of mountains that  \n \n* Such tales are an ancient human tradition; many of them have had, \nfrom the beginning of exploration, a cosmic motif.

Some of these \nstories were true; some were lies. Others had a kernel of truth, \nmisunderstood or exaggerated by the explorers or their informants. In \nthe hands of Voltaire, say, or Jonathan Swift, these accounts \nstimulated a new perspective on European society, forcing a \nreconsideration of that insular world.  \nModern Voyagers also return travelers\u2019 tales, tales of a world \nshattered like a crystal sphere; a globe where the ground is covered, \npole to pole, with what looks like a network of cobwebs; tiny moons \nshaped like potatoes; a world with an underground ocean ; a land that \nsmells of rotten eggs and looks like a pizza pie, with lakes of molten \nsulfur and volcanic eruptions ejecting smoke  \ndirectly into space; a planet called Jupiter that dwarfs our own \u2014so large that \n1,000 Earths would fit within it.  \nThe Galilean satellites of Jupiter are each almost as big as the planet \nMercury. We can measure their sizes and masses and so calculate their \ndensity, which tells us something about the composition of their \ninteriors. We find that the inner two, Io and Eur opa, have a density \nas high as rock. The outer two, Ganymede and Callisto, have a much \nlower density, halfway be-  \ntween rock and ice. But the mixture of ice and rocks within these outer \nmoons must contain, as do rocks on Earth, traces of radioactive \nminerals, which heat their surroundings. There is no effective way for \nthis heat, accumulated over billions of years, to  reach the surface and \nbe lost to space, and the radioactivity inside Ganymede and Callisto \nmust therefore melt their icy interiors.  \nWe anticipate underground oceans of slush and water in these moons, \na hint, before we have ever seen the surfaces of the Galilean satellites \nclose up, that they may be very different one from another. When we \ndo look closely, through the eyes of Voyager, t his prediction is \nconfirmed. They do not resemble each other. They are different from \nany worlds we have ever  \nseen before.  \nThe Voyager 2 spacecraft will never return to Earth. But its \nscientific findings, its epic discoveries, its travelers\u2019 tales, do return. \nTake July 9, 1979, for instance.

Sunlight \nshines on Europa in its orbit around Jupiter and is reflected back to \nspace, where some of it strikes the phosphors of the Voyager television \ncameras, generating an image.

The picture is fundamentally like a newspaper wirephoto, \nmade of perhaps a million individual dots, each a different shade of \ngray, so fine and close together that at a distance the constituent dots \nare invisible. We see only their cumulative effect. The information \nfrom the spacecraft specifies how bright or dark each dot is to be. After \nprocessing, the dots are then stored on a magnetic disc, something like \na phonograph record. There are some eighteen thousand photographs \ntaken in the Jupiter system by Voyager 1 that are stored on such \nmagnetic discs, and an equivalent number for Voyager 2. Finally, the \nend product of this remarkable set of links and relays is a thin piece of \nglossy paper, in this case showing the wonders of E uropa, recorded, \nprocessed and examined for the first time in human history on July 9, \n1979.  \nWhat we saw on such pictures was absolutely astonishing. Voyager \n1 obtained excellent imagery of the other three Galilean satellites of \nJupiter. But not Europa. It was left for Voyager 2 to acquire the first \nclose -up pictures of Europa, where we see things  that are only a few \nkilometers across. At first glance, the place looks like nothing so much \nas the canal network that Percival Lowell imagined to adorn Mars, and \nthat, we now know from space vehicle exploration, does not exist at \nall. We see on Europa an  amazing, intricate network of intersecting \nstraight and curved lines. Are they ridges \u2014that is, raised? Are they \ntroughs \u2014that is, depressed? How are they made? Are they part of a \nglobal tectonic system, produced perhaps by fracturing of an \nexpanding or con tracting planet? Are they connected with plate \ntectonics on the Earth? What light do they shed on the other satellites \nof the Jovian system? At the moment of discovery, the vaunted \ntechnology has produced something astonishing. But it remains for \nanother d evice, the human brain, to figure it out. Europa turns out to \nbe as smooth as a billiard ball despite the network of lineations. The \nabsence of impact craters may be due to the heating and flow of surface \nice upon impact. The lines are grooves or cracks, t heir origin still being \ndebated long after the mission.  \nIf the Voyager missions were manned, the captain would keep a \nship\u2019s log, and the log, a combination of the events of Voyagers 1 and \n2, might read something like this:  \nVoyager 2 image taken July 6, 1979, shows a region of the Jovian atmosphere \nfrom approximately 25\u00b0N to the equator.

The \nplanet is immense. It is more than twice as \nmassive as all the other planets put \ntogether. There are no mountains, valleys, \nvolcanoes,  rivers; no boundaries between \nland and air; just a vast ocean of dense gas \nand floating clouds \u2014a world without a \nsurface. Everything we can see on Jupiter is \nfloating in its sky.  \nDay 630 The weather on Jupiter continues \nto be spectacular. This ponderous world \nspins on its axis in less than ten hours. Its \natmospheric motions are driven by the \nrapid rotation, by sunlight and by the heat \nbubbling and welling up from its interior.  \nDay 640 The cloud patterns are distinctive \nand gorgeous.

The blue \nplaces are apparently deep holes in the overlying clouds through \nwhich we see clear sky.  \nWe do not know the reason for the reddish -brown color of \nJupiter. Perhaps it is due to the chemistry of phosphorus or \nsulfur. Perhaps it is due to complex brightly colored organic \nmolecules produced when ultraviolet light from the Sun breaks \ndown the metha ne, ammonia, and water in the Jovian \natmosphere and the molecular fragments recombine.  \nIn that case, the colors of Jupiter speak to us of chemical events \nthat four billion years ago back on Earth led to the origin of life.  \nDay 647 The Great Red Spot.

But the British have no special \nwisdom here. The word is of Eastern \nMediterranean origin and is pronounced \nthroughout the rest of Europe, correctly, as \n\u201cee-oh.\u201d \n 281 \nTravelers\u2019 Tales  \u2014  \nIo. We could resolve few features on its surface, but we knew it was \nred\u2014extremely red, redder than Mars, perhaps the reddest object in \nthe solar system. Over a period of years something seemed to be \nchanging on it, in infrared light and perhaps in its rad ar reflection \nproperties. We also know that partially surrounding Jupiter in the \norbital position of Io was a great doughnut -shaped tube of atoms, \nsulfur and sodium and potassium, material somehow lost from Io.  \nWhen Voyager approached this giant moon we found a strange \nmulticolored surface unlike any other in the solar system. Io is near \nthe asteroid belt. It must have been thoroughly pum - meled \nthroughout its history by falling boulders. Impact craters must have  \nbeen made. Yet there were none to be seen. Accordingly, there had to \nbe some process on Io that was extremely efficient in rubbing craters \nout or filling them in. The process could not be atmospheric, since \nIo\u2019s atmosphere has mostly escaped to space beca use of its low gravity. \nIt could not be running water; Io\u2019s surface is far too cold. There were \na few places that resembled the summits of volcanoes. But it was hard \nto be sure.  \nLinda Morabito, a member of the Voyager Navigation Team \nresponsible for keeping Voyager precisely on its trajectory, was \nroutinely ordering a computer to enhance an image of the edge of Io, \nto bring out the stars behind it. To her astonishment, she saw a b right \nplume standing off in the darkness from the satellites surface and soon \ndetermined that the plume was in exactly the position of one of the \nsuspected volcanoes. Voyager had discovered the first active volcano \nbeyond the Earth. We know now of nine lar ge volcanoes, spewing out \ngas and debris, and hundreds \u2014perhaps thousands \u2014of extinct \nvolcanoes on Io. The debris, rolling and flowing down the sides of the \nvolcanic mountains, arching in great jets over the polychrome \nlandscape, is more than enough to cover  the impact craters. We are \nlooking at a fresh planetary landscape, a surface newly hatched. How \nGalileo and Huygens would have marveled.  \nThe volcanoes of Io were predicted, before they were discovered, by \nStanton Peale and his co -workers, who calculated the tides that would \nbe raised in the solid interior of Io by the combined pulls of the nearby \nmoon Europa and the giant planet Jupiter. Th ey found that the rocks \ninside Io should have been melted, not by radioactivity but by tides; \nthat much of the interior of Io should be liquid. It now seems likely \nthat the volcanoes of Io are tapping an underground ocean of liquid \nsulfur, melted and conce ntrated near the surface. When solid sulfur \nis heated a little past the normal boiling point of water, to about \n115\u00b0C, it melts and changes color. The higher the temperature, the  282 \ndeeper the color. If the molten sulfur is quickly cooled, it retains its \ncolor. The pattern of colors that we see on Io resembles closely what \nwe would expect if rivers and torrents and sheets of molten  283 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe Antarctic terrain of Io. A great \nprofusion of landscapes can be seen (t op), \nincluding smooth plains, volcanic calderas, \nsulfur flows, steep escarpments, and, at \nbottom right, surrounded by a bright halo, \nrugged and isolated mountains. The \npicture is about 1,700 kilometers across. \nAt bottom is a close -up of a feature seen in \nthe t op picture at left center, a volcanic \nflow pattern 225 kilometers across, \nemanating from a caldera with an irregular \nisland inside. Voyager 1 images. Courtesy  \nNASA.  \nsulfur were pouring out of the mouths of \nthe volcanoes: black sulfur, the hottest, \nnear the top of the volcano; red and \norange, including the rivers, nearby; and \ngreat plains covered by yellow sulfur at a \ngreater remove. The surface of Io is \nchanging on a time scale of months. Maps will have to be issued regularly, like weather reports on Earth. \nThose future explorers on Io will have to keep their wits about them.  \nThe very thin and tenuous atmosphere of Io was found by Voyager \nto be composed mainly of sulfur dioxide. But this thin atmosphere \ncan serve a useful purpose, because it may be just thick enough to \nprotect the surface from the intense charged particles in t he Jupiter \nradiation belt in which Io is embedded. At night the temperature \ndrops so low that the sulfur dioxide should condense out as a kind of \nwhite frost; the charged particles would then immolate the surface, \nand it would probably be wise to spend the  nights just slightly \nunderground.  \nThe great volcanic plumes of Io reach so high that they are close to \ninjecting their atoms directly into the space around Jupiter. The \nvolcanoes are the probable source of the great doughnut -shaped ring \nof atoms that surrounds Jupiter in the position of Io \u2019s orbit. These \natoms, gradually spiraling in toward Jupiter, should coat the inner \nmoon Amalthea and may be responsible for its reddish coloration. It \nis even possible that the material outgassed from Io contributes, after \nmany collisions and condensation s, to the ring system of Jupiter.  \nA substantial human presence on Jupiter itself is much more \ndifficult to imagine \u2014although I suppose great balloon cities \npermanently floating in its atmosphere are a technological possibility \nfor the remote future. As seen from the near sides of Io or Euro pa, \nthat immense and variable world fills much of the sky, hanging aloft, \nnever to rise or set, because almost every satellite in the solar system \nkeeps a constant face to its planet, as the Moon does to the Earth. \nJupiter will be a source of continuing pr ovocation and excitement for \nthe future human explorers of the Jovian moons.  \nAs the solar system condensed out of interstellar gas and dust,  \nJupiter acquired most of the matter that was not ejected into \ninterstellar space and did not fall inward to form the Sun. Had Jupiter \nbeen several dozen times more massive, the matter in its interior would \nhave undergone thermonuclear reactions, and Jupite r would have \nbegun to shine by its own light. The largest planet is a star that failed. \nEven so, its interior temperatures are sufficiently high that it gives off \nabout twice as much energy as it receives from the Sun. In the infrared \npart of the spectrum,  it might even be correct to consider Jupiter a \nstar. Had it become a  \nstar in visible light, we would today inhabit a binary or doublestar \nsystem, with two suns in our sky, and the nights would come more \nrarely \u2014a commonplace, I believe, in countless solar systems \nthroughout the Milky Way Galaxy. We would doubtless think  \n 284 \nTravelers\u2019 Tales \u2014  \nthe circumstances natural and lovely.  \nDeep below the clouds of Jupiter the weight of the overlying layers \nof atmosphere produces pressures much higher than any found on \nEarth, pressures so great that electrons are squeezed off hydrogen \natoms, producing a remarkable substance, liquid metallic h ydrogen \u2014a \nphysical state that has never been observed in terrestrial laboratories, \nbecause the requisite pressures have never been achieved on Earth. \n(There is some hope that metallic hydrogen is a superconductor at \nmoderate temperatures. If it could be ma nufactured on Earth, it would \nwork a revolution in electronics.) In the interior of Jupiter, where the \npressures are about three million times the atmospheric pressure at \nthe surface of the Earth, there is almost nothing but a great dark \nsloshing ocean of metallic hydrogen. But at the very core of Jupiter \nthere may be a lump of rock and iron, an Earth -like world in a pressure \nvise, hidden forever at the center of the largest planet.  \nThe electrical currents in the liquid metal interior of Jupiter may be \nthe source of the planet\u2019s enormous magnetic field, the largest in the \nsolar system, and of its associated belt of trapped electrons and \nprotons. These charged particles are ejected fro m the Sun in the solar \nwind and captured and accelerated by Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Vast \nnumbers of them are trapped far above the clouds and are condemned \nto bounce from pole to pole until by chance they encounter some high -\naltitude atmospheric molecule  and are removed from the radiation \nbelt. Io moves in an orbit so close to Jupiter that it plows through the \nmidst of this intense radiation, creating cascades of charged particles, \nwhich in turn generate violent bursts of radio energy. (They may also \ninfluence eruptive processes on the surface of Io.) It is possible to \npredict radio bursts from Jupiter with better reliability than weather \nforecasts on Earth, by computing the position of Io.  \nThat Jupiter is a source of radio emission was discovered \naccidentally in the 1950\u2019s, the early days of radio astronomy. Two \nyoung Americans, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin, were \nexamining the sky with a newly constructed and for that time very \nsensiti ve radio telescope. They were searching the cosmic radio \nbackground \u2014that is, radio sources far beyond our solar system. To \ntheir surprise, they found an intense and previously unreported source \nthat seemed to correspond to no prominent star, nebula or gal axy. \nWhat is more, it gradually moved, with respect to the distant stars, \nmuch faster than any remote object could.* After finding no likely \nexplanation of all this in their charts of the distant Cosmos, they one \nday stepped outside the observatory and loo ked up at the sky with the \nnaked eye to see if anything interesting happened to be there. Bemu - \nsedly they noted an exceptionally bright object in the right place, \nwhich they soon identified as the planet Jupiter.

And on the evening of \nEncounter, on my way to study the Voyager data arrivi ng at JPL, I \nthought that Jupiter would never be the same, never again just a point \nof light in the night sky, but would forever after be a place  to be \nexplored and known. Jupiter and its moons are a kind of miniature \nsolar system of diverse and exquisite worlds with much to teach us.  \nIn composition and in many other respects Saturn is similar to \nJupiter, although smaller. Rotating once every ten hours, it exhibits \ncolorful equatorial banding, which is, however, not so prominent as \nJupiter\u2019s. It has a weaker magnetic field and radiation  belt than Jupiter \nand a more spectacular set of circumplane - tary rings. And it also is \nsurrounded by a dozen or more satellites.  \nThe most interesting of the moons of Saturn seems to be  \nTitan, the largest moon in the solar system and the only one with a \nsubstantial atmosphere. Prior to the encounter of Voyager 1 with \nTitan in November 1980, our information about Titan was scanty and \ntantalizing. The only gas known unambiguously to be pres ent was \nmethane, CH 4, discovered by G. P. Kuiper. Ultraviolet light from the \n286  \nsun converts methane to more complex \nhydrocarbon molecules and hydrogen \ngas. The hydrocarbons should remain on \nTitan, covering the surface with a \nbrownish tarry organic sludge, something \nlike that produced in experiments on the \norigin of life on Earth. The  lightweight \nhydrogen gas should, because of Titan\u2019s \nlow gravity, rapidly escape to space by a \nviolent process known as \u201cblowoff,\u201d \nwhich should carry the methane and \nother atmospheric constituents with it. \nBut Titan   287 \nTravelers\u2019 Tales  \n\u2014  \n \nhas an atmospheric pressure at least as great as that of the planet Mars. \nBlowoff does not seem to be happening. Perhaps there is some major \nand as yet undiscovered atmospheric constituent \u2014 nitrogen, for \nexample \u2014which keeps the average molecular weight of the atmosphere \nhigh and prevents blowoff. Or perhaps blowoff is happening, but the \ngases lost to space are being replenished by others released from the \nsatellite\u2019s interior. The bulk density of Titan is so low that there must be a vast supply of water and  other ices, \nprobably including methane, which are \nat  \nunknown rates being released to the \nsurface by internal heating.  \nWhen we examine Titan through the \ntelescope we see a barely perceptible \nreddish disc.

But what is responsible \nfor the reddish coloration? Most students \nof Titan agree that complex organic \nmolecules are the most likely \nexplanation. The surface temperature \nand atmospheric thickness are still under \ndebate. There have been som e hints of \nan enhanced surface temperature due to \nan atmospheric greenhouse effect. With \nabundant organic molecules on its \nsurface and in its atmosphere, Titan is a \nremarkable and unique denizen of the \nsolar system. The history of our past \nvoyages of disco very suggests that \nVoyager and other spacecraft  reconnaissance missions will revolutionize our knowledge of this place.  \nThrough a break in the clouds of Titan, you might glimpse Saturn \nand its rings, their pale yellow color diffused by the intervening \natmosphere. Because the Saturn system is ten times farther from the \nSun than is the Earth, the sunshine on Titan is only 1 p ercent as \nintense as we are accustomed to, and the temperatures should be far \nbelow the freezing point of water even with a sizable atmospheric \ngreenhouse effect. But with abundant organic matter, sunlight and \nperhaps volcanic hot spots, the possibility of  life on Titan* cannot be \nreadily dismissed. In that very different environment, it would, of \ncourse, have to be very different from life on Earth. There is no strong \nevidence either for or against life on Titan. It is merely possible. We \nare unlikely to d etermine the answer to this question without landing \ninstrumented space vehicles on the Titanian surface.  \nTo examine the individual particles composing the rings of Saturn, \nwe must approach them closely, for the particles are small \u2014snowballs \nand ice chips and tiny tumbling bonsai glaciers, a meter or so across. \nWe know they are composed of water ice, because t he spectral \nproperties of sunlight reflected off the rings match those of ice in the \nlaboratory measurements. To approach the particles in a space vehicle, \nwe must slow down, so that we move along with them as they circle \nSaturn at some 45,000 miles per ho ur; that is, we must be in orbit \naround Saturn ourselves, moving at the same speed as the particles. \nOnly then will we be able to see them individually and not as smears \nor streaks.  \n \n* The view of Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655, was: \u201cNow can any \none look upon, and compare these Systems [of Jupiter and Saturn] \ntogether, without being amazed at the vast Magnitude and noble \nAttendants of these two Planets, in respect of this littl e pitiful Earth of \nours?

The closer a ring particle is to Saturn, the faster its \norbital speed (the faster it is \u201cfalling\u201d around the planet \u2014 Kepler\u2019s \nthird law); the inner particles are streaming pa st the outer ones (the \n\u201cpassing lane\u201d as we see it is always to the left). Although the whole \nassemblage is tearing around the planet itself at some 20 kilometers \nper second, the relative speed of two adjacent particles is very low, only \nsome few centimete rs per minute. Because of this relative motion, the \nparticles can never stick together by their mutual gravity. As soon as \nthey try, their slightly different orbital speeds pull them apart. If the \nrings were not so close to Saturn, this effect would not be  so strong, \nand the particles could accrete, making small snowballs and eventually \ngrowing into satellites. So it is probably no coincidence that outside \nthe rings of Saturn there is a system of satellites varying in size from a \nfew hundred kilometers acro ss to Titan, a giant moon nearly as large \nas the planet Mars. The matter in all the satellites and the planets \nthemselves may have been originally distributed in the form of rings, \nwhich condensed and accumulated to form the present moons and \nplanets.  \nFor Saturn as for Jupiter, the magnetic field captures and \naccelerates the charged particles of the solar wind. When a charged \nparticle bounces from one magnetic pole to the other, it must cross \nthe equatorial plane of Saturn. If there is a ring particle i n the way, \nthe proton or electron is absorbed by this small snowball. As a result, \nfor both planets, the rings clear out the radiation belts, which exist \nonly interior and exterior to the particle rings. A close moon of Jupiter \nor Saturn will likewise gobb le up radiation belt particles, and in fact \none of the new moons of Saturn was discovered in just this way: \nPioneer 11 found an unexpected gap in the radiation belts, caused by \nthe sweeping up of charged particles by a previously unknown moon.  \nThe solar wind trickles into the outer solar system far beyond the \norbit of Saturn. When Voyager reaches Uranus and the orbits of \nNeptune and Pluto, if the instruments are still functioning, they will \nalmost certainly sense its presence, the wind between t he worlds, the \ntop of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere blown outward toward the realm of the \nstars. Some two or three times farther from the Sun than Pluto is, the \npressure of the interstellar protons and electrons becomes greater than \nthe minuscule pressure there exe rted by the solar wind. That place, \ncalled the heliopause, is one definition of the outer boundary of the \nEmpire of the Sun. But the Voyager spacecraft will plunge on, \npenetrating the heliopause sometime in the middle of the twenty -first \ncentury, skimming through the ocean of space, never to enter another  296 \nsolar system, destined to wander through eternity far from the stellar \nislands and to complete its first circumnavigation of the massive center \nof the Milky Way a few hundred million years from now.

His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain \nunmoved, that th e Earth revolves about the Sun in the circumference of a circle, \nthe Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of the fixed stars, \nsituated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he \nsupposes the Earth to revo lve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed \nstars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface.  \n \n\u2014Archimedes, The Sand Reckoner  \nIf a faithful account was rendered of Man\u2019s ideas upon Divinity, he would be \nobliged to acknowledge, that for the most part the word \u201cgods\u201d has been used to \nexpress the concealed, remote, unknown causes of the effects he witnessed; that \nhe applies this ter m when the spring of the natural, the source of known causes, \nceases to be visible: as soon as he loses the thread of these causes, or as soon as his \nmind can no longer follow the chain, he solves the difficulty, terminates his \nresearch, by ascribing it to  his gods . . . When, therefore, he ascribes to his gods \nthe production of some phenomenon . . . does he, in fact, do any thing more than \nsubstitute for the darkness of his own mind, a sound to which he has been \naccustomed to listen with  \nreverential awe?  \n\u2014Paul Heinrich Dietrich, Baron von Holbach, Syst\u00e8me de la Nature , London, \n1770  The Backbone of Night \u2014 301 \n168 \u2014 Cosmos  \nWHEN I WAS LITTLE , I lived in the Bensonhurst section of \nBrooklyn in the City of New York. I knew my immediate \nneighborhood intimately, every apartment building, pigeon coop, \nbackyard, front stoop, empty lot, elm tree, ornamental railing, coal \nchute and wall for playing Ch inese handball, among which the brick \nexterior of a theater called the Loew\u2019s Stillwell was of superior quality. \n1 knew where many people lived: Bruno and Dino, Ronald and \nHarvey, Sandy, Bernie, Danny, Jackie and Myra. But more than a few \nblocks away, north of the raucous automobile traffic and elevated \nrailway on 86th Street, was a strange unknown territory, off -limits to \nmy wanderings. It could have been Mars for all I knew.  \nEven with an early bedtime, in winter you could sometimes see the \nstars. I would look at them, twinkling and remote, and wonder what \nthey were. I would ask older children and adults, who would only \nreply, \u201cThey\u2019re lights in the sky, kid.\u201d I could see \nthey were lights in the sky. But what were they? Just small hovering \nlamps? Whatever for? I felt a kind of sorrow for them: a commonplace \nwhose strangeness remained somehow hidden from my incurious \nfellows. There had to be some deeper answer.  \nAs soon as I was old enough, my parents gave me my first library \ncard. I think the library was on 85th Street, an alien land. \nImmediately, I asked the librarian for something on stars. She \nreturned with a picture book displaying portraits of men and women \nwith names like Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. I complained, and for \nsome reason then obscure to me, she smiled and found another book \u2014\nthe right kind of book. I opened it breathlessly and read until I found \nit. The book said something astonishing, a very big  thought. It said \nthat the stars were suns, only very far away. The Sun was a star, but \nclose up.  \nImagine that you took the Sun and moved it so far away that it was \njust a tiny twinkling point of light. How far away would you have to \nmove it? I was innocent of the notion of angular size. I was ignorant \nof the inverse square law for light propagation. I  had not a ghost of a \nchance of calculating the distance to the stars. But I could tell that if \nthe stars were suns, they had to be very far away \u2014farther away than \n85th Street, farther away than Manhattan, farther away, probably, \nthan New Jersey. The Cosmo s was much bigger than I had guessed.  \nLater I read another astonishing fact. The Earth, which includes \nBrooklyn, is a planet, and it goes around the Sun. There are other \nplanets. They also go around the Sun; some are closer to it and some \nare farther away. But the planets do not shine by their  own light, as \nthe Sun does. They merely reflect light from  \nthe Sun. If you were a great distance away, you would not see the Earth \nand the other planets at all; they would be only faint luminous points, \nlost in the glare of the Sun. Well, then, I thought, it stood to reason \nthat the other stars must have planets t oo, ones we have not yet \ndetected, and some of those other planets should have life (why not?),  \na kind of life probably different from life as we know it, life in \nBrooklyn. So I decided I would be an astronomer, learn about the \nstars and planets and, if I could, go and visit them.  \nIt has been my immense good fortune to have parents and some \nteachers who encouraged this odd ambition and to live in this time, \nthe first moment in human history when we are, in fact, visiting other \nworlds and engaging in a deep reconnaissance of the Cosm os. If I had \nbeen born in a much earlier age, no matter how great my dedication, \nI would not have understood what the stars and planets are. I would \nnot have known that there were other suns and other worlds. This is \none of the great secrets, wrested from Nature through a million years \nof patient observation and courageous thinking by our ancestors.  \nWhat are the stars? Such questions are as natural as an infant\u2019s \nsmile. We have always asked them. What is different about our time \nis that at last we know some of the answers. Books and libraries \nprovide a ready means for finding out what those answers ar e. In \nbiology there is a principle of powerful if imperfect applicability called \nrecapitulation: in our individual embryonic development we retrace \nthe evolutionary history of the species. There is, I think, a kind of \nrecapitulation that occurs in our indi vidual intellectual developments \nas well. We unconsciously retrace the thoughts of our remote \nancestors. Imagine a time before science, a time before libraries. \nImagine a time hundreds of thousands of years ago. We were then just \nabout as smart, just as cu rious, just as involved in things social and \nsexual. But the experiments had not yet been done, the inventions \nhad not yet been made. It was the childhood of genus Homo. Imagine \nthe time when fire was first discovered. What were human lives like \nthen? What  did our ancestors believe the stars were? Sometimes, in \nmy fantasies, I imagine there was someone who thought like this:  \nWe eat berries and roots. Nuts and leaves. And dead animals.   \nSome animals we find. Some we kill. We know which foods are  good and \nwhich are dangerous. If we taste some foods we are struck  down, in punishment \nfor eating them. We did not mean to do  something bad. But foxglove or \nhemlock can kill you. We love our  children and our friends. We warn them of \nsuch foods.  \nWhen we hunt animals, then also can we be killed. We can be  gored. Or \ntrampled. Or eaten. What animals do means life and  death for us: how they \nbehave, what tracks they leave, their times for  mating and giving birth, their \ntimes for wandering. We must know  these things. We tell our children. They \nwill tell their children.  \nWe depend on animals. We follow them \u2014especially in winter  when there \nare few plants to eat. We are wandering hunters and  gatherers. We call \nourselves the hunterfolk.  \nMost of us fall asleep under the sky or under a tree or in its  branches. We use animal \nskins for clothing: to keep us warm, to    \n170 \u2014 Cosmos  \ncover our nakedness and sometimes as a hammock. When we wear  the animal \nskins we feel the animal\u2019s power. We leap with the  gazelle. We hunt with the \nbear. There is a bond between us and the  animals. We hunt and eat the \nanimals. They hunt and eat us. We  are part of one another.  \nWe make tools and stay alive. Some of us are experts at splitting,  flaking, \nsharpening and polishing, as well as finding, rocks. Some  rocks we tie with \nanimal sinew to a wooden handle and make an ax.  With the ax we strike \nplants and animals. Other rocks are tied to  long sticks. If we are quiet and \nwatchful, we can sometimes come  close to an animal and stick it with the \nspear.  \nMeat spoils. Sometimes we are hungry and try not to notice.   \nSometimes we mix herbs with the bad meat to hide the taste. We  fold foods \nthat will not spoil into pieces of animal skin. Or big  leaves. Or the shell of a \nlarge nut. It is wise to put food aside and  carry it. If we eat this food too early, \nsome of us will starve later. So  we must help one another. For this and many \nother reasons we have  rides. Everyone must obey the rules. We have always \nhad rules.   \nRules are sacred.  \nOne day there was a storm, with much lightning and thunder and  rain. \nThe little ones are afraid of storms. And sometimes so am I.  The secret of the \nstorm is hidden. The thunder is deep and loud; the  lightning is brief and bright. \nMaybe someone very powerful is very  angry. It must be someone in the sky, I \nthink.  \nAfter the storm there was a flickering and crackling in the forest  nearby. \nWe went to see. There was a bright, hot, leaping thing,  yellow and red. We \nhad never seen such a thing before. We now call  it \u201cflame.\u201d It has a special \nsmell. In a way it is alive. It eats food. It  eats plants and tree limbs and even \nwhole trees, if you let it. It is  strong. But it is not very smart. If all the food is \ngone, it dies. It will   \nnot walk a spear\u2019s throw from one tree to another if there is no food  along the \nway. It cannot walk without eating. But where there is  much food, it grows \nand makes many flame children.  \nOne of us had a brave and fearful thought: to capture the flame,  feed it a \nlittle, and make it our friend. We found some long branches  of hard wood. The \nflame was eating them, but slowly. We could  pick them up by the end that had \nno flame. If you run fast with a  small flame, it dies. Their children are weak. \nWe did not run. We  walked, shouting good wishes. \u201cDo not die,\u201d we said to \nthe flame.  The other hunterfolk looked with wide eyes.  \nEver after, we have carried it with us. We have a flame mother  to feed the \nflame slowly so it does not die of hunger.* Flame is a    \n \n* This sense of fire as a living thing, to be protected and cared for, should not \nbe dismissed as a \u201cprimitive\u201d notion. It is to be found near the root of many \nmodern civilizations. Every home in ancient Greece and Rome and among \nthe Brahmans of ancient In dia had a hearth and a set of prescribed rules for \ncaring for the flame. At night the coals were covered with ashes for insulation; \nin the morning twigs were added to revive the flame. The death of the flame \nin the hearth was considered synonymous  \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014 305 \nwonder, and useful too; surely a gift from powerful beings. Are they  the same as \nthe angry beings in the storm?  \nThe flame keeps us warm on cold nights. It gives us light. It makes  holes in \nthe darkness when the Moon is new. We can fix spears at  night for tomorrow\u2019s \nhunt. And if we are not tired, even in the  darkness we can see each other and \ntalk. Also \u2014a good thing! \u2014fire keeps animals away. We can be hurt at night. \nSometimes we have  been eaten, even by small animals, hyenas and wolves. \nNow it is  different. Now the flame keeps the animals back. We see them  baying \nsoftly in the dark, prowling, their eyes glowing in the  light of  the flame. They \nare frightened of the flame. But we are not frightened. The flame is ours. We \ntake care of the flame. The flame takes  care of us.  \nThe sky is important. It covers us. It speaks to us. Before the time  we found \nthe flame, we would lie back in the dark and look up at all  the points of light. \nSome points would come together to make a  picture in the sky. One of us could \nsee the pictures better than the  rest. She taught us the star pictures and what \nnames to call them.  We would sit around late at night and make up stories \nabout the  pictures in the sky: lions, dogs, bears, hunterfolk. Other, stranger  \nthings. Could they be the pictures of the powerful beings in the sky,  the ones \nwho make the storms when angry?  \nMostly, the sky does not change. The same star pictures are there  year after \nyear. The Moon grows from nothing to a thin sliver to a  round ball, and then \nback again to nothing. When the Moon  changes, the women bleed. Some tribes \nhave rules against sex at  certain times in the growing and shrinking of the \nMoon. Some tribes  scratch the days of the Moon or the days that the women \nbleed on  antler bones. Then they can plan ahead and obey their rules. Rules  \nare sacred.  \nThe stars are very far away. When we climb a hill or a tree they  are no \ncloser. And clouds come between us and the stars: the stars  must be behind the \nclouds. The Moon, as it slowly moves, passes in  front of stars. Later you can \nsee that the stars are not harmed. The  Moon does not eat stars. The stars must \nbe behind the Moon. They  flicker. A strange, cold, white, faraway light. Many \nof them. All  over the sky. But only at night. I wonder what they are.  \nAfter we found the flame, 1 was sitting near the campfire wondering about \nthe stars. Slowly a thought came: The stars are flame, I  thought. Then I had \nanother thought: The stars are campfires that  other hunterfolk light at night. \nThe stars give a smaller light than  campfires. So the stars must be campfires \nvery far away. \u201cBut,\u201d they  ask me, \u201chow can there be campfires in the sky? \nWhy do the campfires and the hunter people around those flames not fall down \nat our   \n \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014 306 \nwith the death of the family. In all three cultures, the hearth ritual was \nconnected with the worship of ancestors. This is the origin of the eternal \nflame, a symbol still widely employed in religious, memorial, political and \nathletic ceremonials throughou t the world.  307  \n \u2014 Cosmos  \nfeet? Why don\u2019t strange tribes drop from the sky?\u201d  \nThose are good questions. They trouble me. Sometimes I think the  sky is half \nof a big eggshell or a big nutshell. I think the people  around those faraway \ncampfires look down at us \u2014except for them it  seems up \u2014and say that we are in \ntheir sky, and wonder why we do  not fall up to them, if you see what I mean. \nBut hunterfolk say,  \u201cDown is down and up is up.\u201d That is a good answer, too.  \nThere is another thought that one of us had. His thought is that  night is a \ngreat black animal skin, thrown up over the sky. There are  holes in the skin. \nWe look through the holes. And we see flame. His  thought is not just that there \nis flame in a few places where we see  stars. He thinks there is flame everywhere. \nHe thinks flame covers  the whole sky. But the skin hides the flame. Except \nwhere there are  holes.  \nSome stars wander. Like the animals we hunt. Like us. If you  watch with \ncare over many months, you find they move. There are   \nonly five of them, like the fingers on a hand. They wander slowly  among the \nstars. If the campfire thought is true, those stars must be  tribes of wandering \nhunterfolk, carrying big fires. But I don\u2019t see how   \nwandering stars can be holes in a skin. When you make a hole, there  it is. A \nhole is a hole. Holes do not wander. Also, I don\u2019t want to be  surrounded by a \nsky of flame. If the skin fell, the night sky would be  bright \u2014too bright \u2014like seeing \nflame everywhere. I think a sky of   \nflame would eat us all. Maybe there are two kinds of powerful  beings in the \nsky. Bad ones, who wish the flame to eat us. And good  ones who put up the \nskin to keep the flame away. We must find  some way to thank the good ones.  \nI don\u2019t know if the stars are campfires in the sky. Or holes in a  skin through \nwhich the flame of power looks down on us. Sometimes  I think one way. \nSometimes I think a different way. Once I thought  there are no campfires and \nno holes but something else, too hard for  me to understand.  \nRest your neck on a log. Your head goes back. Then you can see  only the \nsky. No hills, no trees, no hunterfolk, no campfire. Just sky.  Sometimes I feel I \nmay fall up into the sky. If the stars are campfires,   \nI would like to visit those other hunterfolk \u2014the ones who wander.   \nThen I feel good about falling up. But if the stars are holes in a skin,   \nI become afraid. I don\u2019t want to fall up through a hole and into the  flame of \npower.  \n1 wish I knew which was true. I don\u2019t like not knowing.  \nI do not imagine that many members of a hunter/gatherer group \nhad thoughts like these about the stars. Perhaps, over the ages, a few \ndid, but never all these thoughts in the same person. Yet, sophisticated \nideas are common in such communities. For example,  the !Kung* \n308  \nBushmen of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have an explanation for \nthe Milky Way, which at their  \n* The exclamation point is a click, made by touching the tongue against \nthe inside of the incisors, and simultaneously pronouncing the K.  The Backbone of Night \u2014 309 \nlatitude is often overhead. They call it \u201cthe backbone of night,\u201d  \nA reconstruction of the Temple of Hera \non the Greek island of Samos. The largest \ntemple of its time, it was 120 meters long. \nConstruction began in 530 B.C. and \ncontinued until the third century B.C. \nFrom Der Heratempel von  Samos  by Oscar \nReuther (1957).  The Backbone of Night \u2014 310 \n \nas if the sky were some great beast inside which we live. Their \nexplanation makes the Milky Way useful as well as understandable. \nThe !Kung believe the Milky Way holds up the night; that if it were \nnot for the Milky Way, fragments of darkness would come cr ashing \ndown at our feet. It is an elegant idea.  \nMetaphors like those about celestial campfires or galactic \nbackbones were eventually replaced in most human cultures by \nanother idea: The powerful beings in the sky were promoted to gods. \nThey were given names and relatives, and special responsibilities fo r \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014 311 \nthe cosmic services they were expected to perform. There was a god or \ngoddess for every human concern. Gods ran  \nNature. Nothing could happen without their direct intervention. If \nthey were happy, there was plenty of food, and humans were happy. \nBut if something displeased the gods \u2014and sometimes it took very \nlittle\u2014the consequences were awesome: droughts, storms, war s, \nearthquakes, volcanoes, epidemics. The gods had to be propitiated, \nand a vast industry of priests and oracles arose to make the gods less \nangry. But because the gods were capricious, you could not be sure \nwhat they would do. Nature was a mystery. It wa s hard to understand \nthe world.  \nLittle remains of the Heraion on the Aegean isle of Samos, one of \nthe wonders of the ancient world, a great temple dedicated to Hera, \nwho began her career as goddess of the sky. She was the patron deity \nof Samos, playing the same role there as Athena did i n Athens. Much \nlater she married Zeus, the chief of the Olympian gods. They \nhoneymooned on Samos, the old stories tell us. The Greek religion \nexplained that diffuse band of light in the night sky as the milk of \nHera, squirted from her breast across the hea vens, a legend that is the \norigin of the phrase Westerners still use \u2014the Milky Way. Perhaps it \noriginally represented the important insight that the sky nurtures the \nEarth; if so, that meaning seems to have been forgotten millennia ago.  \nWe are, almost all of us, descended from people who responded to \nthe dangers of existence by inventing stories about unpredictable or \ndisgruntled deities. For a long time the human  \nThe only surviving column from the \nTemple of Hera on Samos.  \n312  \n \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nA map of the eastern Mediterranean in instinct to understand was thwarted by facile religious explanaclassical times, \nshowing the cities associ- tions, as in ancient Greece in the time of Homer, where there ated with the great ancient \nscientists. were gods of the sky and the Earth, the thunderstorm, the oceans and the underworld, fire and time and \nlove and war; where every  \ntree and meadow had its dryad and maenad.  \nFor thousands of years humans were oppressed \u2014as some of us still \nare\u2014by the notion that the universe is a marionette whose strings are \npulled by a god or gods, unseen and inscrutable. Then, 2,500 years \nago, there was a glorious awakening in Ionia: on Samos  and the other \nnearby Greek colonies that grew up among the islands and inlets of \nthe busy eastern Aegean Sea.* Suddenly there were people who \nbelieved that everything was made of atoms; that human beings and \nother animals had sprung from simpler forms; th at diseases were not \n313  \ncaused by demons or the gods; that the Earth was only a planet going \naround the Sun. And that the stars were very far away.  \n* As an aid to confusion, Ionia is not in the Ionian Sea; it was named by \ncolonists from the coast of the Ionian Sea.   \nThe Backbone of Night  \u2014 175 \nThis revolution made Cosmos out of Chaos. The early Greeks had \nbelieved that the first being was Chaos, corresponding to the phrase \nin Genesis in the same context, \u201cwithout form.\u201d Chaos created and \nthen mated with a goddess called Night, and their offsprin g eventually \nproduced all the gods and men. A universe created from Chaos was in \nperfect keeping with the Greek belief in an unpredictable Nature run \nby capricious gods. But in the sixth century B.C., in Ionia, a new \nconcept developed, one of the great ide as of the human species. The \nuniverse is knowable, the ancient Ionians argued, because it exhibits \nan internal order: there are regularities in Nature that permit its \nsecrets to be uncovered. Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are \nrules even she m ust obey. This ordered and admirable character of the \nuniverse was called Cosmos.  \nBut why Ionia, why in these unassuming and pastoral landscapes, \nthese remote islands and inlets of the Eastern Mediterranean? Why \nnot in the great cities of India or Egypt, Babylonia, China or \nMesoamerica? China had an astronomical tradition millennia old;  it \ninvented paper and printing, rockets, clocks, silk, porcelain, and \nocean -going navies. Some historians argue it was nevertheless too \ntraditionalist a society, too unwilling to adopt innovations. Why not \nIndia, an extremely rich, mathematically  \ngifted culture? Because, some historians maintain, of a rigid \nfascination with the idea of an infinitely old universe condemned to \nan endless cycle of deaths and rebirths, of souls and universes, in \nwhich nothing fundamentally new could ever happen. Why no t \nMayan and Aztec societies, which were accomplished in astronomy \nand captivated, as the Indians were, by large numbers? Because, some \nhistorians declare, they lacked the aptitude or impetus for mechanical \ninvention. The Mayans and the Aztecs did not even \u2014except for \nchildren\u2019s toys \u2014invent the wheel.  \nThe Ionians had several advantages. Ionia is an island realm. \nIsolation, even if incomplete, breeds diversity. With many different \nislands, there was a variety of political systems. No single \nconcentration of power could enforce social and intellectual \nconformity in all the islands. Free inquiry became possible. The \npromotion of superstition was not considered a political necessity. \nUnlike many other cultures, the Ionians were at the crossroads of \ncivilizations, not at one of the centers. In Ionia, the Phoe nician \nalphabet was first adapted to Greek usage and widespread literacy \nbecame possible. Writing was no longer a monopoly of the priests and \nscribes. The thoughts of many were available for consideration and \ndebate. Political power was in the hands of the  merchants, who  \nactively promoted the technology on which their prosperity depended. \nIt was in the Eastern Mediterranean that African, Asian, and \nEuropean civilizations, including the great cultures of Egypt and \nMesopotamia, met and cross -fertilized in a vigorous and head y \nconfrontation of prejudices, languages, ideas and gods. What do you \ndo when you are  316  \n \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nA doorknob in the shape of a hand in the \nsquare of the town of Mili, on \ncontemporary Samos. Respect for manual \nlabor was one of the keys to the Ionian \nAwakening, centered around Samos, in \nthe sixth through fourth centuries B.C. \nPhoto by Ann Druyan.  \nfaced with several different gods each \nclaiming the same territory? The \nBabylonian Marduk and the Greek Zeus \nwas each considered master of the sky \nand king of the gods. You might decide \nthat Marduk and Zeus were really the \nsame. You might also decide, sinc e they \nhad quite different attributes, that one \nof them was merely invented by the \npriests. But if one, why not both?  \nAnd so it was that the great idea arose, \nthe realization that there might be a way \nto know the world without the god \nhypothesis; that there might be \nprinciples, forces, laws of nature, \nthrough which the world could be \nunderstood without attributing the fal l of every sparrow to the direct intervention of Zeus.  \nChina and India and Mesoamerica would, I think, have tumbled to \nscience too, if only they had been given a little more time. Cultures do \nnot develop with identical rhythms or evolve in lockstep. They arise at \ndifferent times and progress at different rates . The scientific world \nview works so well, explains so much and resonates so harmoniously \nwith the most advanced parts of our brains that in time, I think, \nvirtually every culture on the Earth, left to its own devices, would have \ndiscovered science.  \nSome culture had to be first. As it turned out, Ionia was the place \nwhere science was born.  \nBetween 600 and 400 B.C., this great revolution in human thought \nbegan. The key to the revolution was the hand. Some of the brilliant \nIonian thinkers were the sons of sailors and farmers and weavers. They \nwere accustomed to poking and fixing, unlike the priests and scribes \nof ot her nations, who, raised in luxury, were reluctant to dirty their \nhands. They rejected superstition, and they worked wonders. In many \ncases we have only fragmentary or secondhand accounts of what \nhappened. The metaphors used then may  be obscure to us now. There \nwas almost certainly a conscious effort a few centuries later to suppress \nthe new insights. The leading figures in this revolution were men with \nGreek names, largely unfamiliar to us today, but the truest pioneers in \nthe develo pment of our civilization and our humanity.  \nThe first Ionian scientist was Thales of Miletus, a city in Asia across \na narrow channel of water from the island of Samos. He had traveled \nin Egypt and was conversant with the knowledge of Babylon. It is said \nthat he predicted a solar eclipse. He learned how to measure the height \nof a pyramid from the length of its shadow and the angle of the Sun \nabove the horizon, a method employed today to determine the heights \nof the mountains of the Moon. He was the first to prove geometric \ntheorems of the sort codifie d by Euclid three centuries later \u2014for \nexample, the proposition that the angles at the base of an isosceles \ntriangle are equal. There is a clear continuity of intellectual effort from \nThales to Euclid to Isaac Newton\u2019s purchase of the Elements of Geometry  \nat Stourbridge Fair in 1663 (p. 68), the event that precipitated modern \nscience and technology.  \n \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014 177 \nThales attempted to understand the world without invoking the \nintervention of the gods. Like the Babylonians, he believed the world \nto have once been water. To explain the dry land, the Babylonians \nadded that Marduk had placed a mat on the face of the wate rs and \npiled dirt upon it.* Thales held a similar view, but, as Benjamin \nFarrington said, \u201cleft Marduk out.\u201d Yes, everything was once water, \nbut the Earth formed out of the oceans by a natural process \u2014similar, \nhe thought, to the silting he had observed at the delta of the Nile. \nIndeed, he thought that water was a common principle underlying all \nof matter, just as today we might say the same of electrons, protons \nand neutrons, or of  \nquarks. Whether Thales\u2019 conclusion was correct is not as important \nas his approach: The world was not made by the gods, but instead was \nthe work of material forces interacting in Nature. Thales brought back \nfrom Babylon and Egypt the seeds of the new scien ces of astronomy \nand geometry, sciences that would sprout and grow in the fertile soil \nof Ionia.  \nVery little is known about the personal life of Thales, but one revealing \nanecdote is told by Aristotle in his Politics : \n[Thales] was reproached for his poverty, which was supposed to \nshow that philosophy is of no use. According to the story, he \nknew by his skill [in interpreting the heavens] while it was yet \nwinter that there would be a great harvest of olives in the coming  \nyear; so, having a little money, he gave deposits for the use of all \nthe olive -presses in Chios and Miletus, which he hired at a low \nprice because no one bid against him. When the harvest time \ncame, and many were wanted all at once, he let them out at any  \nrate which he pleased and made a quantity of money. Thus he \nshowed the world philosophers can easily be rich if they like, but \nthat their ambition is of another sort.  \nHe was also famous as a political sage, successfully urging the  \nMilesians to resist assimilation by Croesus, King of Lydia, and \nunsuccessfully urging a federation of all the island states of Ionia to \noppose the Lydians.  \nAnaximander of Miletus was a friend and colleague of Thales, one \nof the first people we know of to do an experiment. By examining the \nmoving shadow cast by a vertical stick he determined accurately the \nlength of the year and the seasons. For ages  \n \n* There is some evidence that the antecedent, early Sumerian creation \nmyths were largely naturalistic explanations, later codified around 1000 \n \nB.C. in the Enuma elish  (\u201cWhen on high,\u201d the first words of the poem); but \nby then the gods had replaced Nature, and the myth offers a theog - ony, \nnot a cosmogony. The Enuma elish  is reminiscent of the Japanese and Ainu \nmyths in which an originally muddy cosmos is beaten by the wings of a \nbird, separating the land from the water. A Fijian creation myth says: \n\u201cRokomautu created the land. He scooped it up out of the bottom of the \nocean in great handfuls and accumulated it in piles here and there. These \nare th e Fiji Islands.\u201d The distillation of land from water is a natural \nenough idea for island and seafaring peoples.  319 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe tunnel of Eupalinos, piercing Mount \nAmpelus on Samos. It is mentioned by \nHerodotus as one of the three great \nachievements of Greek engineering (the \nother two, the Temple of Hera and the \nmole at what is now the harbor of Pytha - \ngorion, were also constru cted on the island \nof Samos). Completed by the slaves of \nPolycrates, around 525 B.C. \nmen had used sticks to club and spear \none another. Anaximander used one to \nmeasure time. He was the first person in \nGreece to make a sundial, a map of the \nknown world and a celestial globe that \nshowed the patterns of the \nconstellations. He believed the Sun , the \nMoon and the stars to be made of fire \nseen through moving holes in the dome \nof the sky, probably a much older idea. \nHe held the remarkable view that the \nEarth is not suspended or supported \nfrom the heavens, but that it remains by \nitself at the center  of the universe; since \nit was equidistant from all places on the \n\u201ccelestial sphere,\u201d there was no force that \ncould move it.  He argued that we are so helpless at birth that, if the first human \ninfants had been put into the world on their own, they would \nimmediately have died. From this Anaximander concluded that \nhuman beings arose from other animals with more self -reliant \nnewbor ns: He proposed the spontaneous origin of life in mud, the \nfirst animals being fish covered with spines. Some descendants of these \nfishes eventually abandoned the water and moved to dry land, where \nthey evolved into other animals by the  \ntransmutation of one form into another. He believed in an infinite \nnumber of worlds, all inhabited, and all subject to cycles of dissolution \nand regeneration. \u201cNor,\u201d as Saint Augustine ruefully complained, \u201cdid \nhe, any more than Thales, attribute the cause  of all this ceaseless \nactivity to a divine mind.\u201d  \nIn the year 540 B.C. or thereabouts, on the island of Samos, there \ncame to power a tyrant named Polycrates. He seems to have started as \na caterer and then gone on to international piracy. Polycrates was a \ngenerous patron of the arts, sciences and engineering. But he \noppressed his own people; he made war on his neighbors; he quite \nrightly feared invasion. So he surrounded his capital city with a \nmassive wall, about six kilometers long, whose remains stand to this \nday. To carry water from a distant spring thr ough the fortifications, he \nordered a great tunnel built. A kilometer long, it pierces a mountain. \nTwo cuttings were dug from either end which met almost perfectly in \nthe middle. The project took about fifteen years to complete, a \ntestament to the civil en gineering of the day and an indication of the \nextraordinary practical capability of the Ionians. But there is another \nand more ominous side to the enterprise: it was built in part by slaves \nin chains, many captured by the pirate ships of Polycrates.  \nThis was the time of Theodorus, the master engineer of the age, \ncredited among the Greeks with the invention of the key, the ruler, \nthe carpenter\u2019s square, the level, the lathe, bronze casting and central \nheating. Why are there no monuments to this man? Th ose who \ndreamed and speculated about the laws of Nature talked with the \ntechnologists and the engineers. They were often the same people. The \ntheoretical and the practical were one.  \nAbout the same time, on the nearby island of Cos, Hippocrates  \n320 \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014  \nwas establishing his famous medical tradition, now barely  \nremembered because of the Hippocratic oath. It was a practical and \neffective school of medicine, which Hippocrates insisted had to be \nbased on the contemporary equivalent of physics and chemistry.* But \nit also had its theoretical side. In his book On Ancient Medicine,  \nHippocrates wrote: \u201cMen think epilepsy divine, merely because they \ndo not understand it. But if they called everything divine which they \ndo not understand, why, there would be no end of divine things.\u201d  \nIn time, the Ionian influence and the experimental method spread \nto the mainland of Greece, to Italy, to Sicily. There was once a time \nwhen hardly anyone believed in air. They knew about breathing, of \ncourse, and they thought the wind was the breath of the  gods. But the \nidea of air as a static, material but invisible substance was unimagined. \nThe first recorded experiment on air was performed by a physician7 \nnamed Empedocles, who flourished around 450 B.C. Some accounts \nclaim he identified himself as a god. But perhaps it was only that he \nwas so clever that others thought him a god. He believed that light \ntravels very fast, but not infinitely fast. He taught that there was once \na much greater variety of li ving things on the Earth, but that many \nraces of beings \u201cmust have been unable to beget and continue their \nkind. For in the case of every species that exists, either craft or courage \nor speed has from the beginning of its existence protected and \npreserv ed it.\u201d In this attempt to explain the lovely adaptation of \norganisms to their environments, Empedocles, like Anaximander and \nDemocritus (see below), clearly anticipated some aspects of Darwin\u2019s \ngreat idea of evolution by natural selection.  \n    Empedocles performed his experiment with a household \nimplement people had used for centuries, the so -called clepsydra  or \n\u201cwater thief,\u201d which was used as a kitchen ladle. A brazen sphere with \nan open neck and small holes in the bottom, it is filled by immersing \nit in water. If you pull it out with the neck uncovered, the water pours \nout of the holes, making a little show er. But it you pull it out properly, \nwith your thumb covering the neck, the water is retained within the \nsphere until you lift your thu mb. If you try to fill it with the neck \ncovered, nothing happens. Some material substance must be in the \nway of the water. We cannot see such a substance. What could it be? \nEmpedocles argued that it could only be air. A thing we cannot see \ncan exert pressure, can  \n \n \n7 The experiment was performed in support of a totally erroneous theory \nof the circulation of the blood, but the idea of performing any experiment \nto probe Nature is the important innovation.  A modern reconstruction of the clepsydra, \nor \u201cwater thief,\u201d with which Empedocles \ndeduced that air was composed of \ninnumerable fine particles.  \n321 \n* And astrology, which was then widely regarded as a science. In a typical \npassage, Hippocrates writes: \u201cOne must also guard against the risings of \nthe stars, especially of the Dog Star [Sirius], then of Arcturus, and also of  \nthe setting of the Pleiades.\u201d  322 \u2014 Cosmos  \nfrustrate my wish to fill a vessel with water if I were dumb enough to \nleave my finger on the neck. Empedocles had discovered the invisible. \nAir, he thought, must be matter in a form so finely divided that it \ncould not be seen.  \nEmpedocles is said to have died in an apotheotic fit by leaping into \nthe hot lava at the summit caldera of the great volcano of Aetna. But \nI sometimes imagine that he merely slipped during a courageous and \npioneering venture in observational geophysics.  \nThis hint, this whiff, of the existence of atoms was carried much \nfurther by a man named Democritus, who came from the Ionian \ncolony of Abdera in northern Greece. Abdera was a kind of joke town. \nIf in 430 B.C. you told a story about someone from Abdera, you were \nguaranteed a laugh. It was in a way the Brooklyn of its time. For \nDemocritus all of life was to be enjoyed and understood; \nunderstanding and enjoyment were the same thing. He said that \u201ca \nlife without fe stivity is a long road without an inn.\u201d Democr itus may \nhave come from Abdera, but he was no dummy. He believed that a \nlarge number of worlds had formed spontaneously out of diffuse \nmatter in space, evolved and then decayed. At a time when no one \nknew about impact craters, Democritus thought that world s on \noccasion collide; he believed that some worlds wandered alone \nthrough the darkness of space, while others were accompanied by \nseveral suns and moons; that some worlds were inhabited, while \nothers had no plants or animals or even water; that the simple st forms \nof life arose from a kind of primeval ooze. He taught that perception \u2014\nthe reason, say, I think there is a pen in my hand \u2014was a purely physical \nand mechanistic process; that thinking and feeling were attributes of \nmatter put together in a sufficien tly fine and complex way and not due \nto some spirit infused into matter by the gods.  \nDemocritus invented the word atom, Greek for \u201cunable to be cut.\u201d \nAtoms were the ultimate particles, forever frustrating our attempts to \nbreak them into smaller pieces. Everything, he said, is a collection of \natoms, intricately assembled. Even we. \u201cNothing exists,\u201d he said, \u201cbut \natoms and t he void.\u201d  \nWhen we cut an apple, the knife must pass through empty spaces \nbetween the atoms, Democritus argued. If there were no such empty \nspaces, no void, the knife would encounter the impenetrable atoms, \nand the apple could not be cut. Having cut a slice from a co ne, say, let \nus compare the cross sections of the two pieces. Are the exposed areas \nequal? No, said Democritus. The slope of the cone forces one side of \nthe slice to have a slightly smaller cross section than the other. If the \ntwo areas were exactly equal,  we would have a cylinder, not a cone. No \nmatter how sharp the knife, the two pieces have unequal cross \nsections. Why? Because, on the scale of the very small, matter exhibits \nsome irreducible roughness. This fine scale of roughness Democritus \nidentified w ith the world of the atoms. His arguments were not those \nwe use today, but they were subtle and elegant, derived  \nThe Backbone of Night  \u2014  \nfrom everyday life. And his conclusions were fundamentally correct.  323 \nIn a related exercise, Democritus imagined calculating the volume \nof a cone or a pyramid by a very large number of extremely small \nstacked plates tapering in size from the base to the apex. He had stated \nthe problem that, in mathematics, is called the theo ry of limits. He \nwas knocking at the door of the differential and integral calculus, that \nfundamental tool for understanding the world that was not, so far as \nwe know from written records, in fact discovered until the time of \nIsaac Newton. Perhaps if Democ ritus\u2019 work had not been almost \ncompletely destroyed, there would have been calculus by the time of \nChrist.*  \nThomas Wright marveled in 1750 that Democritus had believed \nthe Milky Way to be composed mainly of unresolved stars: \u201clong \nbefore astonomy reaped any benefit from the improved sciences of \noptics; [he] saw, as we may say, through the eye of reason, full as far \ninto infinity as the most able astronomers in more advantageous times \nhave done since.\u201d Beyond the Milk of Hera, past the Backbone of \nNight, the mind of Democritus soared.  \nAs a person, Democritus seems to have been somewhat unusual. \nWomen, children and sex discomfited him, in part because they took \ntime away from thinking. But he valued friendship, held cheerfulness \nto be the goal of life and devoted a major philosophical in quiry to the \norigin and nature of enthusiasm. He journeyed to Athens to visit \nSocrates and then found himself too shy to introduce himself. He was \na close friend of Hippocrates. He was awed by the beauty and elegance \nof the physical world. He felt that pov erty in a democracy was \npreferable to wealth in a tyranny. He believed that the prevailing \nreligions of his time were evil and that neither immortal souls nor \nimmortal gods  \nexist: \u201cNothing exists, but atoms and the void.\u201d  \nThere is no record of Democritus having been persecuted for his \nopinions \u2014but then, he came from Abdera. However, in his time the \nbrief tradition of tolerance for unconventional views began to erode \nand then to shatter. People came to be punished for having  unusual \nideas. A portrait of Democritus is now on the Greek hundred -\ndrachma bill. But his insights were suppressed, his influence on \nhistory made minor. The mystics were beginning to win.  \n    Anaxagoras was an Ionian experimentalist who flourished around \n450 B.C. and lived in Athens. He was a rich man, indifferent to his \nwealth but passionate about science. Asked what was the purpose of \nlife, he replied, \u201cthe investigation of the Sun, the Moon, and the \nheavens,\u201d the reply of a true astronomer. He performed a clev er \nexperiment in which a single drop of white liquid, like cream, was \nshown not to lighten perceptibly the  \n \n* The frontiers of the calculus were also later breached by Eudoxus and Archimedes.  \n324 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nA recent 100 -drachma note from Greece, \nbearing a symbolic atom (lithium), a \nlikeness of Democritus, and a modern \nGreek nuclear research institute named \nafter Democritus.  \ncontents of a great pitcher of dark liquid, \nlike wine. There must, he concluded, be \nchanges deductible by experiment that are \ntoo subtle to be perceived directly by the \nsenses.  \nAnaxagoras was not nearly so radical as \nDemocritus. Both were thoroughgoing \nmaterialists, not in prizing possessions but \nin holding that matter alone provided the \nunderpinnings of the world. Anaxagoras \nbelieved in a special mind substance and \ndisbelieved i n the existence of atoms. He \nthought humans were more intelligent \nthan other animals because of our hands, \na very Ionian idea.  \nHe was the first person to state clearly \nthat the Moon shines by reflected light, \nand he accordingly devised a theory of the \nphases of the Moon. This doctrine was so \ndangerous that the manuscript describing \nit had to be circulated in secret, an \nAthenian samizdat . It was not in keeping \nwith the prejudices of the time to explain \nthe phases or eclipses of the Moon by the \nrelative geometry of the Earth, the Moon \nand the self -luminous Sun. Aristotle, two \ngenerations later, was content to argue \nthat those things happened because it was \nthe nature of the Moon to have phases \nand eclipses \u2014mere verbal juggling, an \nexplanation that explains nothing.  \nThe prevailing belief was that the Sun \nand Moon were gods.  Anaxagoras held that the Sun and stars are fiery stones. We do not \nfeel the heat of the stars because they are too far away. He also thought \nthat the Moon has mountains (right) and inhabitants (wrong). He held \nthat the Sun was so huge that it was probably larger than the \nPeloponnesus, roughly the southern third of Greece. His critics \nthought this estimate excessive and absurd.  \nAnaxagoras was brought to Athens by Pericles, its leader in its time \nof greatest glory, but also the man whose actions led to the \nPeloponnesian War, which destroyed Athenian democracy.  \nPericles delighted in philosophy and science, and Anaxagoras was one \nof his principal confidants. There are those who think that in this role \nAnaxagoras contributed significantly to the greatness of Athens. But \nPericles had political problems. He was too p owerful to be attacked \ndirectly, so his enemies attacked those close to him. Anaxagoras was \nconvicted and imprisoned for the religious crime of impiety \u2014because \nhe had taught that the Moon was made of ordinary matter, that it was \na place, and that the Sun w as a red -hot stone in the sky. Bishop John \nWilkins commented in 1638 on these Athenians: \u201cThose zealous \nidola - tors [counted] it a great blasphemy to make their God a stone, \nwhereas notwithstanding they were so senseless in their adoration of \nidols as to m ake a stone their God.\u201d Pericles seems to have engineered \nAnaxagoras\u2019 release from prison, but it was too late. In Greece the tide \nwas turning, although the Ionian tradition continued in Alexandrian \nEgypt two hundred years later.  \nThe great scientists from Thales to Democritus and Anaxagoras  \n325 \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014  \nhave usually been described in history or philosophy books  \nas \u201cPresocratics,\u201d as if their main function was to hold the \nphilosophical fort until the advent of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle \nand perhaps influence them a little. Instead, the old Ionians represent \na different and largely contradictory tradition, one in much better \naccord with modern science. That their influence was felt powerfully \nfor only two or three centuries is an irreparable loss for all those \nhuman beings who lived between the Ionian Awakening and the \nItalian Renaissance.  \nPerhaps the most influential person ever associated with Samos was \nPythagoras,* a contemporary of Polycrates in the sixth century B.C.  \nAccording to local tradition, he lived for a time in a cave on the \nSamian Mount Kerkis, and was the first person in the history of the \nworld to deduce that the Earth is a sphere. Perhaps he argued by \nanalogy with the Moon and the Sun, or noticed the curved  shadow of \nthe Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, or recognized that when \nships leave Samos and recede over the ho rizon, their masts disappear \nlast. \nHe or his disciples discovered the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of \nthe squares of the shorter sides of a right triangle equals the square of \nthe longer side. Pythagoras did not simply enumerate examples of this \ntheorem; he developed a method of mathematica l deduction to prove \nthe thing generally. The modern tradition of mathematical argument, \nessential to all of science, owes much to Pythagoras. It was he who first \nused the word Cosmos  to denote a well -ordered and harmonious \nuniverse, a world amenable to hu man understanding.  \nMany Ionians believed the underlying harmony of the universe to \nbe accessible through observation and experiment, the method that \ndominates science today. However, Pythagoras employed a very \ndifferent method. He taught that the laws of Nature could be dedu ced \nby pure thought. He and his followers were not fundamentally \nexperimentalists.8  They were mathematicians. And they were \nthoroughgoing mystics. According to Bertrand Russell, in a perhaps \nuncharitable passage, Pythagoras  \n \n \n8  Although there were a few welcome exceptions. The Pythagorean \nfascination with whole -number ratios in musical harmonies seems clearly to \nbe based on observation, or even experiment on the sounds issued from \nplucked strings. Empedocles was, at least in par t, a Pythagorean. One of \nPythagoras\u2019 students, Alcmaeon, is the first person known to have dissected \na human body; he distinguished between arteries and veins, was the first to * The sixth century B.C. was a time of \nremarkable intellectual and spiritual ferment \nacross the planet. Not only was it the time of \nThales, Anaximander, Pythagoras and others \nin Ionia, hut also the time of the  \nEgyptian Pharaoh Necho who caused Africa \nto be circumnavigated, of Zoroaster in Persia, \nConfucius and Lao -tse in China, the Jewish \nprophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylon, and \nGautama Buddha in India. It is hard to think \nthese activities altogether unrelated . \n \nAn ancient Samian coin from the third \ncentury A.D. with a representation of \nPythagoras and the Greek legend, \n\u201cPythagoras of Samos.\u201d Reproduced by \ncourtesy of the Trustees of the British \nMuseum.  \ndiscover the optic nerve and the \neustachian tubes, and identified \nthe brain as the seat of the \nintellect (a contention later  \n326  \n \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe five perfect solids of Pythagoras and  \nPlato, on a ledge outside the cave atop \nMount Kerkis, on Samos, in which according \nto local tradition Pythagoras lived. The solids \nresting on the ledge are (left to  right)  the \ntetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron and \nthe icosahedron. Atop the cube, representing \nearth, is the dodecahedron, mystically \nassociated by the Pythagoreans with the \nheavens.  \n\u201cfounded a religion, of which the main \ntenets were the transmigration of souls \nand the sinfulness of eating beans. His \nreligion was embodied in a religious \norder, which, here and there, acquired \ncontrol of the State and established a \nrule of the saints. Bu t the unregenerate \nhankered after beans, and sooner or later \nrebelled.\u201d  \nThe Pythagoreans delighted in the \ncertainty of mathematical \ndemonstration, the sense of a pure and \nunsullied world accessible  to the human \nintellect, a Cosmos in which the sides of \nright triangles perfectly obey simple \nmathematical relationships. It was in \nstriking contrast to the messy reality of the workaday world. They believed that in their mathematics they had \nglimpsed a perfect reality, a realm of the gods, of which our familiar \nworld is but an imperfect reflection. In Plato\u2019s famous parable of the \ncave, prisoners were imagined tied in such a way that they saw only the \nshadows of passersby and believed the shadows to be real \u2014never \nguessing the complex reality that was accessible if they would but turn \ntheir heads. The Pythagoreans would powerfully infl uence Plato and, \nlater, Christianity.  \nThey did not advocate the free confrontation of conflicting points \nof view. Instead, like all orthodox religions, they practiced a rigidity \nthat prevented them from correcting their errors. Cicero wrote:  \nIn discussion it is not so much weight of authority as force of \nargument that should be demanded. Indeed, the authority of \nthose who profess to teach is often a positive hin-  \ndrance to those who desire to learn; they cease to employ their \nown judgment, and take what they perceive to be the verdict of \ntheir chosen master as settling the question. In fact I am not \ndisposed to approve the practice traditionally ascribed to the \nPythagoreans, who, when questioned as to the grounds of any \nassertion that they advanced in debate, are said to have been \naccustomed to reply \u201cThe Master said so,\u201d \u201cthe Master\u201d being \nPythagoras. So potent was an opinion already decided, making \nauthority preva il unsupported  \nby reason.  \nThe Pythagoreans were fascinated by the regular solids, symmetrical \nthree -dimensional objects all of whose sides are the same regular \npolygon. The cube is the simplest example, having six squares as sides. \nThere are an infinite number of regular polygons, but only five regular \nsolids. (The proof of this statement, a famous example of mathematical \nreasoning, is given in Appendix 2.) For some reason, knowledge of a \nsolid called the dodecahedron having twelve pentagons as sides \nseemed to them dangerous. It was  mystically associated with the \nCosmos. The other  \n \ndenied by Aristotle, who placed intelligence in the heart, and then revived \nby Herophilus of Chalcedon). He also founded the science of embryology. \nBut Alcmaeon\u2019s zest for the impure was not shared by most of his \nPythagorean colleagues in later times.  \n327 \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014  \nfour regular solids were identified, somehow, with the four \u201celements\u201d \nthen imagined to constitute the world: earth, fire, air and water. The \nfifth regular solid must then, they thought, correspond to some fifth \nelement that could only be the substance of the heavenly bodies. (This \nnotion of a fifth essence is the origin of our word quintessence.) \nOrdinary people were to be kept ignorant of the dodecahedron.  \n \nimportant  mathematical  discoveries,  the Pythagoreans sup-  \n \nwere also deemed \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nThe pros and cons of the Pythagorean tradition can be seen clearly \nin the life\u2019s work of Johannes Kepler (Chapter 3). The Pythagorean \nidea of a perfect and mystical world, unseen by the senses, was readily \naccepted by the early Christians and was an integr al component of \nKepler\u2019s early training. On the one hand, Kepler was convinced that \nmathematical harmonies exist in nature (he wrote that \u201cthe universe \nwas stamped with the adornment of harmonic proportions\u201d); that \nsimple numerical relationships must deter mine the motion of the \nplanets. On the other hand, again following the Pythagoreans, he long \nbelieved that only uniform circular motion was admissible. He \nrepeatedly  \n328 \nfound that the observed planetary motions could not be explained in this \nway, and repeatedly tried again. But unlike many  \n \n* A Pythagorean named Hippasus published the secret of the \u201csphere with \ntwelve pentagons,\u201d the dodecahedron. When he later died in a shipwreck, \nwe are told, his fellow Pythagoreans remarked on the justice of the \npunishment. His book has not survived.  \n329 \u2014 Cosmos  \nPythagoreans, he believed in observations and experiment in the real \nworld. Eventually the detailed observations of the apparent motion of \nthe planets forced him to abandon the idea of circular paths and to \nrealize that planets travel in ellipses. Kepler w as both inspired in his \nsearch for the harmony of planetary motion and delayed for more \nthan a decade by the attractions of Pythagorean doctrine.  \nA disdain for the practical swept the ancient world. Plato urged \nastronomers to think about the heavens, but not to waste their time \nobserving them. Aristotle believed that: \u201cThe lower son are by nature \nslaves, and it is better for them as for all inferior s that they should be \nunder the rule of a master. . . . The slave shares in his master\u2019s life; the \nartisan is less closely connected with him, and only attains excellence \nin proportion as he becomes a slave. The meaner sort of mechanic has \na special and se parate slavery.\u201d Plutarch wrote: \u201cIt does not of necessity \nfollow that, if the work delight you with its grace, the one who wrought \nit is worthy of esteem.\u201d Xenophon\u2019s opinion was: \u201cWhat are called the \nmechanical arts carry a social stigma and are rightly dishonoured in \nour cities.\u201d As a result of such attitudes, the brilliant and promising \nIonian experimental method was largely abandoned for two thousand \nyears. Without experiment, there is no way to choose among \ncontending hypotheses, no way for science to  advance. The \nantiempirical taint of the Pythagoreans survives to this day. But why? \nWhere did this distaste for experiment come from?  \nAn explanation for the decline of ancient science has been put \nforward by the historian of science, Benjamin Farrington: The \nmercantile tradition, which led to Ionian science, also led to a slave \neconomy. The owning of slaves was the road to wealth and pow er. \nPolycrates\u2019 fortifications were built by slaves. Athens in the time of \nPericles, Plato and Aristotle had a vast slave population. All the brave \nAthenian talk about democracy applied only to a privileged few. What \nslaves characteristically perform is ma nual labor. But scientific \nexperimentation is manual labor, from which the slaveholders are \npreferentially distanced; while it is only the slaveholders \u2014politely \ncalled \u201cgentle -men\u201d in some societies \u2014who have the leisure to do \nscience. Accordingly, almost n o one did science. The Ionians were \nperfectly able to make machines of some elegance. But the availability \nof slaves undermined the economic motive for the development of \ntechnology. Thus the mercantile tradition contributed to the great \nIonian awakening a round 600 B.C., and, through slavery, may have \nbeen the cause of its decline some two centuries later. There are great \nironies here.  \n    Similar trends are apparent throughout the world. The high point \nin indigenous Chinese astronomy occurred around 1280, with the 330 \u2014 Cosmos  \nwork of Kuo Shou -ching, who used an observational baseline of 1,500 \nyears and improved both astronomical instruments  331 \nThe Backbone of Night \n\u2014  \n \nand mathematical techniques for computation. It is generally thought \nthat Chinese astronomy thereafter underwent a steep decline. Nathan \nSivin believes that the reason lies at least partly \u201cin increasing rigidity \nof elite attitudes, so that the educated we re less inclined to be curious \nabout techniques and less willing to value science as an appropriate \npursuit for a gentleman.\u201d The occupation of astronomer became a \nhereditary office, a practice inconsistent with the advance of the \nsubject. Additionally, \u201ct he responsibility for the evolution of \nastronomy remained centered in the Imperial Court and was largely \nabandoned to foreign technicians,\u201d chiefly the Jesuits, who had \nintroduced Euclid and Copernicus to the astonished Chinese, but \nwho, after the censorsh ip of the latter\u2019s book, had a vested interest in \ndisguising and suppressing heliocentric cosmology. Perhaps science \nwas stillborn in Indian, Mayan and Aztec civilizations for the same \nreason it declined in Ionia, the pervasiveness of the slave economy. A \nmajor problem in the contemporary (political) Third World is that the \neducated classes tend to be the children of the wealthy, with a vested \ninterest in the status quo, and are unaccustomed either to working with their hands or to challenging \nconventional wisdom. Science has been \nvery slow to take root.  \nPlato and Aristotle were comfortable \nin a slave society. They offered \njustifications for oppression. They \nserved tyrants. They taught the \nalienation of the body from the mind (a \nnatural  \nApproximate lifetimes of Ionian and other \nGreek scientists between the seventh \ncentury b.c. and the fifth century. The \ndecline of Greek science is indicated by the \nrelatively few individuals shown after the \nfirst century b.c. \n332 \u2014 Cosmos  \nenough ideal in a slave society); they separated matter from thought; \nthey divorced the Earth from the heavens \u2014divisions that were to \ndominate Western thinking for more than twenty centuries. Plato, \nwho believed that \u201call things are full of gods,\u201d actually  used the \nmetaphor of slavery to connect his politics with his cosmology. He is \nsaid to have urged the burning of all the books of Democritus (he had \na similar recommendation for the books of Homer), perhaps because \nDemocritus did not acknowledge immortal souls or immortal gods or \nPythagorean mysticism, or because he believed in an infinite number \nof worlds. Of the seventy -three books Democritus is said to have \nwritten, covering all of human knowledge, not a single work survives. \nAll we know is from fragmen ts, chiefly on ethics, and secondhand \naccounts. The same is true of almost all the other ancient Ionian \nscientists.  \nIn the recognition by Pythagoras and Plato that the Cosmos is \nknowable, that there is a mathematical underpinning to nature, they \ngreatly advanced the cause of science. But in the suppression of \ndisquieting facts, the sense that science should be kept for a small elite, \nthe distaste for experiment, the embrace of mysticism and the easy \nacceptance of slave societies, they set back the human enterprise. After \na long mystical sleep in which the tools of scientific inquiry lay \nmoldering, the Ionian approach, in  some cases transmitted through \nscholars at the Alexandrian Library, was finally rediscovered. The \nWestern world reawakened. Experiment and open inquiry became \nonce more respectable. Forgotten books and fragments were again \nread. Leonardo and Columbus and Copernicus were inspired by or \nindependently retraced parts of this ancient Greek tradition. There is \nin our time much Ionian science, although not in politics and religion, \nand a fair amount of courageous free inquiry. But there are also \nappalling superst itions and deadly ethical ambiguities. We are flawed \nby ancient contradictions.  \nThe Platonists and their Christian successors held the peculiar \nnotion that the Earth was tainted and somehow nasty, while the \nheavens were perfect and divine. The fundamental idea that the Earth \nis a planet, that we are citizens of the Universe, was rejec ted and \nforgotten. This idea was first argued by Aristarchus, born on Samos \nthree centuries after Pythagoras. Aristarchus was one of the last of the \nIonian scientists. By this time, the center of intellectual enlightenment \nhad moved to the great Library of  Alexandria. Aristarchus was the first \nperson to hold that the Sun rather than the Earth is at the center of \nthe planetary system, that all the planets go around the Sun rather \nthan the Earth. Typi -  \ncally, his writings on this matter are lost. From the size of the Earth\u2019s \nshadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, he deduced that the Sun 333 \u2014 Cosmos  \nhad to be much larger than the Earth, as well as very far away. He may \nthen have reasoned that it is absurd for so large a body as the Sun to \nrevolve around so small a body as the Earth. He put the Sun at the \ncenter, made the Earth rotate on its axis  334 \nThe Backbone of Night \u2014  \nonce a day and orbit the Sun once a year.  \nIt is the same idea we associate with the name of Copernicus, whom \nGalileo described as the \u201crestorer and confirmer,\u201d not the inventor, of \nthe heliocentric hypothesis.* For most of the 1,800 years between \nAristarchus and Copernicus nobody knew the correct disposition of \nthe planets, even though it had been laid out perfectly clearly around \n280 B.C. The idea outraged some of Aristarchus\u2019 contemporaries. \nThere were cries, like those voiced about Anaxagoras and Bruno and \nGalileo, that he be condemned for impie ty. The resistance to \nAristarchus and Copernicus, a kind of geocentrism in everyday life, \nremains with us: we still talk about the Sun \u201crising\u201d and the Sun \n\u201csetting.\u201d It is 2,200 years since Aristarchus, and our language still \npretends that the Earth does not turn.  \nThe separation of the planets from one another \u2014forty million \nkilometers from Earth to Venus at closest approach, six billion \nkilometers to Pluto \u2014would have stunned those Greeks who were \noutraged by the contention that the Sun might be as large as the \nPelop onnesus. It was natural to think of the solar system as much \nmore compact and local. If I hold my finger before my eyes and \nexamine it first with my left and then with my right eye, it seems to \nmove against the distant background. The closer my finger is, the more \nit seems to move. I can estimate the distance to my finger from the \namount of this apparent motion, or parallax. If my eyes were farther \napart, my finger would seem to move substantially more. The longer \nthe baseline from which we make our two obs ervations, the greater the \nparallax and the better we can measure the distance to remote objects. \nBut we live on a moving platform, the Earth, which every six months \nhas progressed from one end of its orbit to the other, a distance of \n300,000,000 kilometer s. If we look at the same unmoving celestial \nobject six months apart, we should be able to measure very  \ngreat distances. Aristarchus suspected the stars to be distant suns. He \nplaced the Sun \u201camong\u201d the fixed stars. The absence of detectable \nstellar parallax as the Earth moved suggested that the stars were much \nfarther away than the Sun. Before the invention  of the telescope, the \nparallax of even the nearest stars was too small to detect. Not until the \nnineteenth century was the parallax of a star first measured. It then \nbecame clear, from straightforward Greek geometry, that the stars \nwere light -years away.  \n \n* Copernicus may have gotten the idea from reading about Aristarchus.  \nRecently discovered classical texts were a source of great excitement in \nItalian universities when Copernicus went to medical school there. In the \n335 \nmanuscript of his book, Copernicus mentioned Aristarchus\u2019 priority, but \nhe omitted the citation before the book saw print. Copernicus wrote in a \nletter to Pope Paul III: \u201cAccording to Cicero, Nicetas had thought the \nEarth was moved . . . According to Pluta rch [who discusses Aristarchus] . \n. . certain others had held the same opinion. When from this, therefore, \nI had conceived its possibility, I myself also began to meditate upon the \nmobility of the Earth.\u201d   \u2014 Cosmos  \n190 \n \nA simple reconstruction of the perforated \nbrass plate used by Christiaan Huygens in \nthe seventeenth century to determine the \ndistance to the stars.  \nThere is another way to measure the \ndistance to the stars which the Ionians \nwere fully capable of discovering, although, \nso far as we know, they did not employ it. \nEveryone knows that the farther away an \nobject is, the smaller it seems. This inverse \npropor tionality between apparent size and \ndistance is the basis of perspective in art \nand photography. So the farther away we \nare from the Sun, the smaller and dimmer it appears. How far would we have to be from the Sun for it to appear \nas small and as dim as a  star? Or, equivalently, how small a piece of the \nSun would be as bright as a star?  \nAn early experiment to answer this question was performed by \nChristiaan Huygens, very much in the Ionian tradition. Huygens \ndrilled small holes in a brass plate, held the plate up to the Sun and \nasked himself which hole seemed as bright as he remembered th e \nbright star Sirius to have been the night before. The hole was \neffectively* 1/28,000 the apparent size of the Sun. So Sirius, he \nreasoned, must be 28,000 times farther from us than the Sun, or about \nhalf a light -year away. It is hard to remember just how  bright a star is \nmany hours after you look at it, but Huygens remembered very well. If \nhe had known that Sirius was intrinsically brighter than the Sun, he \nwould have come up with almost exactly the right answer: Sirius is 8.8 \nlight-years away. The fact t hat Aristarchus and Huygens used imprecise \ndata and derived imperfect answers hardly matters. They explained \ntheir methods so clearly that, when better observations were available, \nmore accurate answers could be derived.  \nBetween the times of Aristarchus and Huygens, humans answered \nthe question that had so excited me as a boy growing up in Brooklyn: \nWhat are the stars? The answer is that the stars are mighty suns, light -\nyears away in the vastness of interstellar space.  \nThe great legacy of Aristarchus is this: neither we nor our planet \nenjoys a privileged position in Nature. This insight has since been \napplied upward to the stars, and sideways to many subsets of the \nhuman family, with great success and invariable oppositi on. It has been \nresponsible for major advances in astronomy, physics, biology, \nanthropology, economics and politics. I wonder if its social \nextrapolation is a major reason for attempts at its suppression.  \nThe legacy of Aristarchus has been extended far beyond the realm \nof the stars. At the end of the eighteenth century, William Herschel, \nmusician and astronomer to George III of England, completed a \nproject to map the starry skies and found apparently equal numbers of \nstars in all directions in the plane or band of the Milky Way; from this, \nreasonably enough, he deduced that we were at the center of the \nGalaxy.\u2020 Just before World War I,  \n \n* Huygens actually used a glass bead to reduce the amount of light passed \nby the hole.  \n\u2020 This supposed privileged position of the Earth, at the center of what  \n337 \nThe Backbone of Night  \u2014  \nHarlow Shapley of Missouri devised a technique for measuring  \nthe distances to the globular clusters, those lovely spherical arrays of \nstars which resemble a swarm of bees. Shapley had found a stellar \nstandard candle, a star noticeable because of its variability, but which \nhad always the same average intrinsic bright ness. By comparing the \nfaintness of such stars when found in globular clusters with their real \nbrightness, as determined from nearby representatives, Shapley could \ncalculate how far away they are - just as, in a field, we can estimate the \ndistance of a lant ern of known intrinsic brightness from the feeble \nlight that reaches us \u2014essentially, the method of Huygens. Shapley \ndiscovered that the globular clusters were not centered around the \nsolar neighborhood but rather about a distant region of the Milky \nWay, in  the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, the Archer. It \nseemed to him very likely that the globular clusters used in this \ninvestigation, nearly a hundred of them, would be orbiting about, \npaying homage to, the massive center of the Milky Way.  \nShapley had in 1915 the courage to propose that the solar system \nwas in the outskirts and not near the core of our galaxy. Herschel had \nbeen misled because of the copious amount of obscuring dust in the \ndirection of Sagittarius; he had no way to know of th e enormous \nnumbers of stars beyond. It is now very clear that we live some 30,000 \nlight-years from the galactic core, on the fringes of a spiral arm, where \nthe local density of stars is relatively sparse. There may be those who \nlive on a planet that orbits  a central star in one of Shapley\u2019s globular \nclusters, or one located in the core. Such beings may pity us for our \nhandful of naked -eye stars, because their skies will be ablaze with them. \nNear the center of the Milky Way, millions of brilliant stars would  be \nvisible to the naked eye, compared to our paltry few thousand. Our \nSun or suns might set, but the night would never come.  \nWell into the twentieth century, astronomers believed that there \nwas only one galaxy in the Cosmos, the Milky Way \u2014although in the \neighteenth century Thomas Wright of Durban and Immanuel Kant of \nKonigsberg each had a premonition that the exquisite luminous spiral \nforms, viewed through the telescope, were other galaxies. Kant suggested explicitly that M31 in the \nconstellation Andromeda was another \nMilky Way, composed of enormous \nnumbers of stars, and proposed calling \nsuch objects by the evocative and \nhaunting  phrase \u201cisland universes.\u201d \nSome scientists toyed with the idea that \nthe spiral nebulae were not distant \nisland universes but rather nearby \ncondensing clouds of interstellar gas, \nperhaps on their way to make solar \nsystems. To test the distance of the spira l \nnebulae, a class of intrinsically much \nbrighter variable stars was needed to \nfurnish a new standard  \n \nSchematic representation of the Milky Way \nviewed edge -on, surrounded by a swarm of \nglobular star clusters, each containing \nbetween one hundred thousand and ten \nmillion stars. On this scale the Sun and \nEarth lie close to the outer edge of the spiral \narms, j utting out from the galactic core. \nPainting by Jon Lomberg.  \nwas then considered the known universe, led A.

Such stars, identified in M31 by Edwin Hubble in 1924, were \ndiscovered to be alarmingly dim, and it became apparent that M31 \nwas a prodigious distance away, a number now estimated at a little \nmore than two million light -years. But if M31 were at su ch a distance, \nit could not be a cloud of mere inter-  \nstellar dimensions; it had to be much larger \u2014an immense galaxy in its \nown right. And the other, fainter galaxies must be more distant still, \na hundred billion of them, sprinkled through the dark to the frontiers \nof the known Cosmos.  \nAs long as there have been humans, we have searched for our place \nin the Cosmos. In the childhood of our species (when our ancestors \ngazed a little idly at the stars), among the Ionian scientists of ancient \nGreece, and in our own age, we have been transfix ed by this question: \nWhere are we? Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant \nplanet of a humdrum star lost between two spiral arms in the outskirts \nof a galaxy which is a member of a sparse cluster of galaxies, tucked \naway in some forgotten corn er of a universe in which there are far \nmore galaxies than people. This perspective is a courageous \ncontinuation of our penchant for constructing and testing mental \nmodels of the skies; the Sun as a red -hot stone, the stars as celestial \nflame, the Galaxy a s the backbone of night.  \nSince Aristarchus, every step in our quest has moved us farther \nfrom center stage in the cosmic drama. There has not been much time \nto assimilate these new findings. The discoveries of Shapley and \nHubble were made within the lifetimes of many people still alive \ntoday. There are those who secretly deplore these great discoveries, \nwho consider every step a demotion, who in their heart of hearts still \npine for a universe whose center, focus and fulcrum is the Earth. But \nif we are to deal with the Cosmos we mus t first understand it, even if \nour hopes for some unearned preferential status are, in the process, \ncontravened. Understanding where we live is an essential \nprecondition for improving the neighborhood. Knowing what other \nneighborhoods are like also helps. If we long for our planet to be \nimportant, there is something we can do about it. We make our world \nsignificant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our \nanswers.  \nWe embarked on our cosmic voyage with a question first framed in \nthe childhood of our species and in each generation asked anew with \nundiminished wonder: What are the stars? Ex-   \nploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are \nwanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the \ncosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.   \n \n \nA hypothetical ice planet in the system of the Ring Nebula in Lyra.

The last two views would be seen if \nwe were able to travel to the proper vantage \npoints, about 150 light - years away.  THE RISING AND FALLING  of the surf is produced in part by tides. \nThe Moon and the Sun are far away. But their gravitational influence \nis very real and noticeable back here on Earth. The beach reminds us \nof space. Fine sand grains, all more or less uniform in size, have been \nprod uced from larger rocks through ages of jostling and rubbing, \nabrasion and erosion, again driven through waves and weather by the \ndistant Moon and Sun. The beach also reminds us of time. The world \nis much older than the human species.  \nA handful of sand contains about 10,000 grains, more than the \nnumber of stars we can see with the naked eye on a clear night. But \nthe number of stars we can see is only the tiniest fraction of the \nnumber of stars that are. What we see at night is the merest smattering \nof the nearest stars. Meanwhile the Cosmos is rich beyond measure: \nthe total number of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains \nof sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth.  \nDespite the efforts of ancient astronomers and astrologers to put \npictures in the skies, a constellation is nothing more than an arbitrary \ngrouping of stars, composed of intrinsically dim stars that seem to us \nbright because they are nearby, and intrinsica lly brighter stars that are \nsomewhat more distant. All places on Earth are, to high precision, the \nsame distance from any star. This is why the star patterns in a given \nconstellation do not change as we go from, say, Soviet Central Asia to \nthe American Mid west. Astronomically, the U.S.S.R. and the United \nStates are the same place. The stars in any constellation are all so far \naway that we cannot recognize them as a three -dimensional \nconfiguration as long as we are tied to Earth. The average distance \nbetween  the stars is a few light -years, a light -year being, we remember, \nabout ten trillion kilometers. For the patterns of the constellations to \nchange, we must travel over distances comparable to those that \nseparate the stars; we must venture across the light -years. Then some \nnearby stars will seem to move out of the constellation, others will \nenter it, and its configuration will alter dramatically.  \nOur technology is, so far, utterly incapable of such grand interstellar \nvoyages, at least in reasonable transit times. But our computers can be \ntaught the three -dimensional positions of all the nearby stars, and we \ncan ask to be taken on a little trip \u2014a circumnavigation of the collection \nof bright stars that constitute the Big Dipper, say \u2014and watch the \nconstellations change. We connect the stars in typical constellations, \nin the usual celestial follow -the-dots drawings. As we change our \nperspective, we see their apparent shapes distort severely. The \ninhabitants of the planets of distant stars witness quite different \nconstellations in their night skies than we do in ours \u2014other Rorschach \n347  \ntests for other minds. Perhaps sometime \nin the next few centuries a spaceship \nfrom Earth will actually travel such \ndistances at some  348 \nTravels in Space and Time \u2014  \nremarkable speed and see new constellations that no human has  \never viewed before \u2014except with such a computer.  \nThe appearance of the constellations changes not only in space but \nalso in time; not only if we alter our position but also if we merely wait \nsufficiently long. Sometimes stars move together in a group or cluster; \nother times a single star may move very ra pidly with respect to its \nfellows. Eventually such stars leave an old constellation and enter a \nnew one. Occasionally, one member of a double -star system explodes, \nbreaking the gravitational shackles that bound its companion, which \nthen leaps into space at  its former orbital velocity, a slingshot in the \nsky. In addition, stars are born, stars evolve, and stars die. If we wait \nlong enough, new stars appear and old stars vanish. The patterns in \nthe sky slowly melt and alter.  \nEven over the lifetime of the human species \u2014a few million years \u2014\nconstellations have been changing. Consider the present \nconfiguration of the Big Dipper, or Great Bear. Our computer can \ncarry us in time as well as in space. As we run the Big Dipper backward s \ninto the past, allowing for the motion of its stars, we find quite a \ndifferent appearance a million years ago. The Big Dipper then looked \nquite a bit like a spear. If a time machine dropped you precipitously \nin some unknown age in the distant past, you c ould in principle \ndetermine the epoch by the configuration of the stars: If the Big \nDipper is a spear, this must be the Middle Pleistocene.  \nWe can also ask the computer to run a constellation forward into \ntime. Consider Leo the Lion. The zodiac is a band of twelve \nconstellations seemingly wrapped around the sky in the apparent \nannual path of the Sun through the heavens. The root of the word is  \nthat for zoo, because the zodiacal constellations, like Leo, are mainly \nfancied to be animals. A million years from now, Leo will look still less \nlike a lion than it does today. Perhaps our remote descendants will call \nit the constellation of the radio te lescope \u2014although I suspect a million \nyears from now the radio telescope will have become more obsolete \nthan the stone spear is now.  \nThe (nonzodiacal) constellation of Orion, the hunter, is outlined \nby four bright stars and bisected by a diagonal line of three stars, which \nrepresent the belt of the hunter. Three dimmer stars hanging from the \nbelt are, according to the conventional astro nomical projective test, \nOrion\u2019s sword. The middle star in the sword is not actually a star but \na great cloud of gas called the Orion Nebula, in which stars are being \nborn. Many of the stars in Orion are hot and young, evolving rapidly \nand ending their liv es in colossal cosmic explosions called supernovae. \nThey are born and die in periods of tens of millions of years. If, on \nour computer, we were to run Orion rapidly into the far future, we would see a startling effect, the births and \nspectacular deaths of many of its stars, \nflashing on and winking off like fireflies \nin the night.  \n \n \n \nComputer -generated images of the Big \nDipper as it would have been seen on  \nEarth one million years ago and half a \nmillion years ago.

At some \npositions in its orbit, Proxima is the closest known star to the Sun \u2014\nhence its name. Most stars in the sky are members of double or \nmultiple star systems. Our solitary Sun is something of an anomaly.  \nThe second brightest star in the constellation Andromeda, called \nBeta Andromedae, is seventy -five light -years away. The light by which \nwe see it now has spent seventy -five years traversing the dark of \ninterstellar space on its long journey to Earth.  \nIn the unlikely event that Beta Andromedae blew itself up last  \nTuesday, we would not know it for another seventy -five years, as this \ninteresting information, traveling at the speed of light, would require \nseventy -five years to cross the enormous interstellar distances. When \nthe light by which we now see this star set out on its long voyage, the \nyoung Albert Einstein, working as a Swiss patent clerk, had just \npublished his epochal special theory of relativity here on Earth.  \nSpace and time are interwoven. We cannot look out into space \nwithout looking back into time. Light travels very fast. But space is very \nempty, and the stars are far apart. Distances of seventy - five light -years \nor less are very small compared to other dist ances in astronomy. From \nthe Sun to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy is 30,000 light -years. \nFrom our galaxy to the nearest spiral galaxy, M31, also in the \nconstellation Andromeda, is 2,000,000 light -years. When the light we \nsee today from M31 left for Ea rth, there were no humans on our \nplanet, although our ancestors were evolving rapidly to our present \nform. The distance from the Earth to the most remote quasars is eight \nor ten billion light - years. We see them today as they were before the \nEarth accumula ted, before the Milky Way was formed.  \nThis is not a situation restricted to astronomical objects, but only \nastronomical objects are so far away that the finite speed of light \nbecomes important. If you are looking at a friend three meters (ten \nfeet) away, at the other end of the room, you are n ot seeing her as she \nis \u201cnow\u201d; but rather as she \u201cwas\u201d a hundred millionth of a second ago. \n[(3 m) / (3 X 108 m/sec) = 1/(108/ sec) = 10-8 sec, or a hundredth of a \nmicrosecond. In this cal-  \nculation we have merely divided the distance by the speed to get the \ntravel time.] But the difference between your friend \u201cnow\u201d and now \nminus a hundred -millionth of a second is too small to notice. On the \nother hand, when we look at a quasar eight billion light-years away, \nthe fact that we are seeing it as it was eight billion years ago may be \nvery important. (For example, there are those who think that quasars \nare explosive events likely to happen only in the early history of \n350  \ngalaxies. In that case, the more distant \nthe galaxy, the earlier in its history we are \nobserving it,  351 \nTravels in Space and Time \u2014  \nand the more likely it is that we should see it as a quasar. Indeed,  \nthe number of quasars increases as we look to distances of more than \nabout five billion light -years).  \nThe two Voyager interstellar spacecraft, the fastest machines ever \nlaunched from Earth, are now traveling at one ten -thousandth the \nspeed of light. They would need 40,000 years to go the distance to the \nnearest star. Do we have any hope of leaving  \nEarth and traversing the immense distances even to Proxima  \nCentauri in convenient periods of time? Can we do something to \napproach the speed of light? What is magic about the speed of  \nlight? Might we someday be able to go faster than that?  \nIf you had walked through the pleasant Tuscan countryside in the \n1890\u2019s, you might have come upon a somewhat long -haired teenage \nhigh school dropout on the road to Pavia. His teachers in Germany \nhad told him that he would never amount to anything, that his  \nquestions destroyed classroom discipline, that he would be better off \nout of school. So he left and wandered, delighting in the freedom of \nNorthern Italy, where he could ruminate on matters remote from the \nsubjects he had been force -fed in his highly disc iplined Prussian \nschoolroom. His name was Albert Einstein, and his ruminations \nchanged the world.  \nEinstein had been fascinated by Bernstein\u2019s People\u2019s Book of  Natural \nScience , a popularization of science that described on its very first page \nthe astonishing speed of electricity through wires and light through \nspace. He wondered what the world would look like if you could travel \non a wave of light. To travel at the speed of ligh t! What an engaging \nand magical thought for a boy on the road in a countryside dappled \nand rippling in sunlight. You could not tell you were on a light wave \nif you traveled with i t. If you started on a wave crest, you would stay \non the crest and lose all notion of it being a wave. Something strange \nhappens at the speed of light. The more Einstein thought about such \nquestions, the more troubling they became. Paradoxes seemed to \nemer ge everywhere if you could travel at the speed of light. Certain \nideas had been accepted as true without sufficiently careful thought. \nEinstein posed simple questions that could have been asked centuries \nearlier. For example, what do we mean when we say th at two events \nare simultaneous?  \nImagine that I am riding a bicycle toward you. As I approach an \nintersection I nearly collide, so it seems to me, with a horse - drawn \ncart. I swerve and barely avoid being run over. Now think of the event \nagain, and imagine that the cart and the bicycle ar e both traveling close \nto the speed of light. If you are standing down the road, the cart is \ntraveling at right angles to your line of sight. You see me, by reflected sunlight, traveling toward you. Would \nnot my speed be added to the speed of \nlight, so tha t my image would get to you \nconsiderably before the image of the cart? \nShould you not see me swerve before you \nsee the cart arrive? Can the cart and I \napproach the intersection \nsimultaneously  \n \nAlbert Einstein (1879 -1955). Portrait by  \nJean-Leon Huens, \u00a9 National Geographic  \nSociety. His latent interest in science was \nawakened at age twelve by a book of \npopular science given him by an \nimpoverished student named Max Talmey, \nwho had been invited to dinner, in an act \nof charity and compassion, by Einstein\u2019s \nparents.  \n352  \n \u2014 Cosmos  \nfrom my point of view, but not from yours? Could I experience a near collision with the cart while you perhaps \nsee me swerve around nothing and pedal cheerfully on toward the town of Vinci? These are curious and subtle \nquestions. They challenge the obvious . There is a reason that no one thought of them before Einstein. From such \nelementary questions, Einstein produced a fundamental rethinking of the world, a revolution in physics.  \nIf the world is to be understood, if we are to avoid such logical paradoxes when traveling at high speeds, there \nare some rules, commandments of Nature, that must be obeyed. \nEinstein codified these rules in the special theory of relativity. Light \n(reflected or emitted) from an object travels at the same velocity \nwhether the object is moving or stationary: Thou shalt not add thy \nspeed to the speed of light . Also, no material object may move faster \nthan light: Thou shalt not travel at or beyond the speed of l ight. Nothing \nin physics prevents you from traveling as close to the speed of light \nas you like; 99.9 percent of the speed of light would be just fine. \nBut no matter how hard you try, you can never gain that last \ndecimal point. For the world to be logically con sistent, there must \nbe a cosmic speed limit. Otherwise, you could get to any speed you \nwanted by adding velocities on a moving platform.  \nEuropeans around the turn of the century generally believed in \nprivileged frames of reference: that German, or French, or British \nculture and political organization were better than those of other \ncountries; that Europeans were superior to other peoples wh o were \nfortunate enough to be colonized. The social and political  \nThe simultaneity paradox in special \nrelativity. The observer is standing in the \nsouth leg of a crossroads. A bicyclist is \napproaching from the north at a velocity \ngiven by the solid arrow. Light reflected \nfrom the bicyclist is approaching the \nobserver at a  higher velocity, given by the \ndashed arrow. A cart is approaching the \nintersection from the west at a velocity \ngiven by its solid arrow, and light is \nreflected off it to the south at a velocity \ngiven by the corresponding dashed arrow. \nIf it were proper to  add the bicyclist\u2019s \nvelocity to the velocity of light (since he is \napproaching the observer), the light from \nthe bicyclist would arrive before the light \nfrom the cart, and what is perceived as a \nnear-collision by the bicyclist and cart \ndriver is witnessed  very differently by the \nobserver. Careful experiments show that this is not what happens. The paradox is noticeable only if the bicycle \nis moving very close to the speed of light. The resolution of the paradox \nis that the velocity of light must be indepen dent of the velocity of the \nmoving object.  \napplication of the ideas of Aristarchus and Copernicus was rejected \nor ignored. The young Einstein rebelled against the notion of \nprivileged frames of reference in physics as much as he did in politics. \nIn a universe filled with stars rushing helter -skelter in all directions, \nthere was no place that was \u201cat rest,\u201d no frame work from which to view \nthe universe that was superior to any other framework. This is what \nthe word relativity  means. The idea is very simple, despite its magical \ntrappings: in viewing th e universe, every place is as good as every other \nplace. The laws of Nature must be identical no matter who is \ndescribing them. If this is to be true \u2014and it would be stunning if there \nwere something special about our insignificant location in the \nCosmos \u2014then it follows that no one may travel faster than light.  \nWe hear the crack of a bullwhip because its tip is moving faster than \nthe speed of sound, creating a shock wave, a small sonic boom. A \nthunderclap has a similar origin. It was once thought that airplanes \ncould not travel faster than sound. Today supersonic  flight is \ncommonplace. But the light barrier is different from the sound barrier. \nIt is not merely an engineering problem like the one the supersonic \n353  \nairplane solves. It is a fundamental law of \nNature, as basic as gravity. And there are \nno phenomena in our experience \u2014like \nthe crack of the bullwhip or the clap of  354 \nTravels in Space and Time  \u2014  \nthunder for sound \u2014to suggest the possibility of traveling in a  \nvacuum faster than light. On the contrary, there is an extremely wide \nrange of experience \u2014with nuclear accelerators and atomic clocks, for \nexample \u2014in precise quantitative agreement with special relativity.  \nThe problems of simultaneity do not apply to sound as they do to \nlight because sound is propagated through some material medium, \nusually air. The sound wave that reaches you when a friend is talking \nis the motion of molecules in the air. Light, however, tr avels in a \nvacuum. There are restrictions on how molecules of air can move \nwhich do not apply to a vacuum. Light from the Sun reaches us across \nthe intervening empty space, but no matter how carefully we listen, we \ndo not hear the crackle of sunspots or th e thunder of the solar flares. \nIt was once thought, in the days before relativity, that light did \npropagate through a special medium that permeated all of space, \ncalled \u201cthe lumin - iferous aether.\u201d But the famous Michelson -Morley \nexperiment demonstrated th at such an aether does not exist.  \nWe sometimes hear of things that can travel faster than light. \nSomething called \u201cthe speed of thought\u201d is occasionally proffered. \nThis is an exceptionally silly notion \u2014especially since the speed of \nimpulses through the neurons in our brains is about the sa me as the \nspeed of a donkey cart. That human beings have been clever enough \nto devise relativity shows that we think well, but I do not think we can \nboast about thinking fast. The electrical impulses in modern \ncomputers do, however, travel nearly at the sp eed of light.  \nSpecial relativity, fully worked out by Einstein in his middle \ntwenties, is supported by every experiment performed to check it. \nPerhaps tomorrow someone will invent a theory consistent with \neverything else we know that circumvents paradoxes on such matter s \nas simultaneity, avoids privileged reference frames and still permits \ntravel faster than light. But I doubt it very much. Einstein\u2019s \nprohibition against traveling faster than light may clash with our \ncommon sense. But on this question, why should we trus t common \nsense? Why should our experience at 10 kilometers an hour constrain \nthe laws of nature at 300,000 kilometers per second? Relativity does \nset limits on what humans can ultimately do. But the universe is not \nrequired to be in perfect harmony with hu man ambition. Special \nrelativity removes from our grasp one way of reaching the stars, the \nship that can go faster than light. Tantalizingly, it suggests another and \nquite unexpected method.  \nFollowing George Gamow, let us imagine a place where the speed \nof light is not its true value of 300,000 kilometers per second, but \nsomething very modest: 40 kilometers per hour, say \u2014and strictly \nenforced. (There are no penalties for breaking laws of Natur e, because there are no crimes: Nature is \nselfregulating and merely arranges things \nso that its prohibitions are  \n \nA traffic signal briefly erected in the Italian \ntown of Vinci.

Photo by \nthe author.  \nimpossible to transgress.) Imagine that \nyou are approaching the speed of light \non a motor scooter. (Relativity is rich in \nsentences beginning \u201cImagine . . .\u201d \nEinstein called such an exercise a Ge- \ndankenexperiment , a thought experiment.) \nAs your speed increases, you begin to see \naround the corners of passing objects. \nWhile you are rigidly facing forward, \nthings that are behind you appear within \nyour forward field of vision. Close to the \nspeed of light, from your poi nt of view, \nthe world looks very odd \u2014ultim ately \neverything is squeezed into a tiny circular \nwindow, which stays just ahead of you. \nFrom the standpoint of a stationary \nobserver, light reflected off you is \nreddened as you depart and blued as you \nreturn. If you travel toward the observer \nat almost th e speed of light, you will become enveloped in an eerie chromatic radiance: your usually \ninvisible infrared emission will be shifted to the shorter visible \nwavelengths. You become compressed in the direction of motion, your \nmass increases, and time, as you  experience it, slows down, a \nbreathtaking consequence of traveling close to the speed of light called \ntime dilation. But from the standpoint of an observer moving with \nyou\u2014perhaps the scooter has a second seat \u2014none of these effects \noccur.  \nThese peculiar and at first perplexing predictions of special relativity \nare true in the deepest sense that anything in science is true. They \ndepend on your relative motion. But they are real, not optical \nillusions. They can be demonstrated by simple mathe matics, mainly \nfirst-year algebra and therefore understandable to any educated \nperson. They are also consistent with many experiments. Very accurate \nclocks carried in airplanes slow down a little compared to stationary \nclocks. Nuclear accelerators are desi gned to allow for the increase of \nmass with increasing speed; if they were not designed in this way, \naccelerated particles would all smash into the walls of the apparatus, \nand there would be little to do in experimental nuclear physics. A \nspeed is a distan ce divided by a time. Since near the velocity of light \nwe cannot simply add speeds, as we are used to doing in the workaday \nworld, the familiar notions of absolute space and absolute time - \nindependent of your relative  motion \u2014must give way. That is why you \nshrink. That is the reason for time dilation.  \nTraveling close to the speed of light you would hardly age at all, but \nyour friends and your relatives back home would be aging at the usual \nrate. When you returned from your relativistic journey, what a \ndifference there would be between your friends and y ou, they having \naged decades, say, and you having aged hardly at all! Traveling close to \nthe speed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down \nclose to the speed of light, special relativity provides us with a means \nof going to the stars.  But is it possible, in terms of practical \nengineering, to travel close to the speed of light? Is a starship feasible?  \nTuscany was not only the caldron of some of the thinking of the \nyoung Albert Einstein; it was also the home of another great  \nTravels in Space and Time \u2014 356 \ngenius who lived 400 years earlier, Leonardo da Vinci, who delighted \nin climbing the Tuscan hills and viewing the ground from a great \nheight, as if he were soaring like a bird. He drew the first aerial \nperspectives of landscapes, towns and fortifications. Among \nLeonardo\u2019s many interests and accomplishments \u2014in painting, \nsculpture, anatomy, geology, natural history, military and civil \nengineering \u2014he had a great passion: to devise and fabricate a machine \nthat could fly. He drew pictures, constructed models, bu ilt full -size \nprototypes \u2014and not one of them worked. No sufficiently powerful and \nlightweight engine then existed. The designs, however, were brilliant \nand encouraged the engineers of future times. Leonardo himself was \ndepressed by these failures. But it w as hardly his fault. He was trapped \nin the fif-  \nteenth century.  \nA similar case occurred in 1939 when a group of engineers calling \nthemselves the British Interplanetary Society designed a ship to take \npeople to the Moon \u2014using 1939 technology. It was by no means \nidentical to the design of the Apollo spacecraft, which acc omplished \nexactly this mission three decades later, but it suggested that a mission \nto the moon might one day be a practical engineering possibility.  \nToday we have preliminary designs for ships to take people to the \nstars. None of these spacecraft is imagined to leave the Earth directly. \nRather, they are constructed in Earth orbit from where they are \nlaunched on their long interstellar journeys. One of them was called \nProject Orion after the constellation, a reminder that the ship\u2019s \nultimate objective was the stars. Orion was designed to utilize \nexplosions of hydrogen bombs, nuclear weapons, against an inertial \nplate, each explosion providing a kind of \u201c putt-putt,\u201d a vast nuclear \nmotorboat in space. Orion seems entirely practical from an \nengineering point of view. By its very nature it would have produced \nvast quantities of radioactive debris, but for conscientious mission \nprofiles only in the emptiness o f interplanetary or interstellar space. \nOrion was under serious development in the United States until the \nsigning of the international treaty that forbids the detonation of \nnuclear weapons in space. This seems to me a great pity. The Orion \nstarship is the  best use of nuclear weapons I can think of.  \nProject Daedalus is a recent design of the British Interplanetary  \nSociety. It assumes the existence of a nuclear fusion reactor \u2014 \nsomething much safer as well as more efficient than existing fission \npower plants. We do not have fusion reactors yet, but they are \nconfidently expected in the next few decades. Orion and Daeda lus \nmight travel at 10 percent the speed of light. A trip to Alpha Centauri, \n4.3 light -years away, would then take forty - three years, less than a \nhuman lifetime. Such ships could not travel close enough to the speed \nof light for special relativistic time dilation to become important. Even with optimistic projections on the \ndevelopment of our technology, it does \nnot seem  \n \nTwo of Leonardo\u2019s designs for flying \nmachines.

This design influenced Otto Li - \nlienthal\u2019s hang gliders of 1891 -96, which immediately preceded the \ninventions of Wilbur and Orville Wr ight.

Or \nperhaps a safe means of hibernation for humans will be found, so that \nthe space travelers could be frozen and then reawakened centuries \nlater. These nonrelativistic starships, enormously expensive as they \nwould be, look relatively easy to design and  build and use compared \nto starships that travel close to the speed of light. Other star systems \nare accessible to the human species, but only after great effort.  \nFast interstellar spaceflight \u2014with the ship velocity approaching the \nspeed of light \u2014is an objective not for a hundred years but for a \nthousand or ten thousand. But it is in principle possible. A kind of \ninterstellar ramjet has been proposed by R. W. Bussar d which scoops \nup the diffuse matter, mostly hydrogen atoms, that floats between the \nstars, accelerates it into a fusion engine and ejects it out the back. The \nhydrogen would be used both as fuel and as reaction mass. But in deep \nspace there is only about one atom in every ten cubic centimeters, a \nvolume the size of a grape. For the ramjet to work, it needs a frontal \nscoop hundreds of kilometers across. When the ship reaches \nrelativistic velocities, the hydrogen atoms will be moving with respect \nto the spac eship at close to the speed of light. If adequate precautions \nare not taken, the spaceship and its passengers will be fried by these \ninduced cosmic rays. One proposed solution uses a laser to strip the \nelectrons off the interstellar atoms and make them ele ctrically charged \nwhile they are still some distance away, and an extremely strong \nmagnetic field to deflect the charged atoms into the scoop and away \nfrom the rest of the spacecraft. This is engineering on a scale so far \nunprecedented on Earth. We are tal king of engines the size of small \nworlds.  \nBut let us spend a moment thinking about such a ship. The  \nEarth gravitationally attracts us with a certain force, which if we are \nfalling we experience as an acceleration. Were we to fall out of a tree \u2014\nand many of our proto -human ancestors must have done so \u2014we would \nplummet faster and faster, increasing our fall speed by ten meters (or \nthirty -two feet) per second, every second. This acceleration, which \ncharacterizes the force of gravity holding us to the Earths surface, is \ncalled 1 g, g for Earth gravity. We are comfortable with accelerations \nof 1 g; we have grown  up with 1 g. If we lived in an interstellar \nspacecraft that could accelerate at 1 g, we would find ourselves in a \nperfectly natural environment. In fact, the equivalence between 362 \u2014 Cosmos  \ngravitational forces and the forces we would feel in an accelerating \nspaceship is a major feature of Einstein\u2019s later general theory of \nrelativity. With a  Travels in Space and Time \u2014 363 \ncontinuous 1 g acceleration, after one year in space we would be traveling very \nclose to the speed of light [(0.01 km/sec2) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 \n107 sec) = 3 \u00d7  105 km/sec].  \nSuppose that such a spacecraft accelerates at 1 g, approaching more and \nmore closely to the speed of light until the midpoint of  \nthe journey; and then is turned around and decelerates at 1 g until \narriving at its destination. For most of the trip the velocity would be \nvery close to the speed of light and time would slow down enormously. \nA nearby mission objective, a sun that may hav e planets, is Barnard\u2019s \nStar, about six light -years away. It could be reached in about eight years \nas measured by clocks aboard the ship; the center of the Milky Way, \nin twenty -one years; M31, the Andromeda galaxy, in twenty -eight \nyears. Of course, people left behind on Earth would see things \ndifferently. Instead of twenty - one years to the center of the Galaxy, \nthey would measure an elapsed time of 30,000 years. When we got \nhome, few of our friends would be left to greet us. In principle, such \na journey, m ounting the decimal points ever closer to the speed of \nlight, would even permit us to circumnavigate the known universe in \nsome fifty -six years ship time. We would return tens of billions of years \nin our future \u2014to find the Earth a charred cinder and the Su n dead. \nRelativistic spaceflight makes the universe accessible to advanced \ncivilizations, but only to those who go on the journey. There seems to \nbe no way for information to travel back to those left behind any faster \nthan the speed of light.  \nThe designs for Orion, Daedalus and the Bussard Ramjet are \nprobably farther from the actual interstellar spacecraft we will one day \nbuild than Leonardo\u2019s models are from today\u2019s supersonic transports. \nBut if we do not destroy ourselves, I believe that we w ill one day \nventure to the stars. When our solar system is all explored, the planets \nof other stars will beckon.  \nSpace travel and time travel are connected. We can travel fast into \nspace only by traveling fast into the future. But what of the past? Could \nwe return to the past and change it? Could we make events turn out \ndifferently from what the history books assert?  We travel slowly into \nthe future all the time, at the rate of one day every day. With \nrelativistic spaceflight we could travel fast into the future. But many \nphysicists believe that a voyage into the past is impossible. Even if you \nhad a device that coul d travel backwards in time, they say, you would \nbe unable to do anything that would make any difference. If you \njourneyed into the past and prevented your parents from meeting, \nthen you would never have been born \u2014which is something of a \ncontradiction, sinc e you clearly exist. Like the proof of the irrationality \nof \u221a2, like the discussion of simultaneity in special relativity, this is Travels in Space and Time \u2014 364 \nan argument in which the premise is challenged because the \nconclusion seems absurd.  \nBut other physicists propose that two alternative histories, two equally valid \nrealities, could exist side by side \u2014the one you know  365 \n208 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nA symbolic representation of time travel.  \nThe Time Machine is that built for the  \nGeorge Pal motion picture based on the  \nH.

If that \nkind of time travel were possible, then ever y imaginable alternative \nhistory might in some sense really exist.  \nHistory consists for the most part of a complex bundle of deeply \ninterwoven threads, social, cultural and economic forces that are not \neasily unraveled. The countless small, unpredictable and random \nevents that flow on continually often have no long - range  \nconsequences. But some, those occurring at critical junctures or \nbranch points, may change the pattern of history.

It is hardly anything at a ll. \nOn the other hand, suppose our time traveler had persuaded  \nQueen Isabella that Columbus\u2019 geography was faulty, that from \nEratosthenes\u2019 estimate of the circumference of the Earth, Columbus \ncould never reach Asia. Almost certainly some other European would \nhave come along within a few decades and sailed west to the New \nWorld. Improvements in navigation, the lure of the spice trade and \ncompetition among rival European powers made the discovery of \nAmerica around 1500 more or less inevitable. Of course, there would \ntoday be no nation of Colombia, or District of Columbia  or \nColumbus, Ohio, or Columbia University in the Americas. But the \noverall course of history might have turned out more or less the same. \nIn order to affect the future profoundly, a time traveler would \nprobably have to intervene in a number of carefully c hosen events, to \nchange the  \nweave of history.  \nIt is a lovely fantasy, to explore those worlds that never were.  \n \nBy visiting them we could truly \nunderstand how history works; history \ncould become an experimental science. If \nan apparently pivotal person had never \nlived\u2014Plato, say, or Paul, or Peter the \nGreat \u2014how different would the world be? \nWhat if the scientific tra dition of the \nancient Ionian Greeks had survived and \nflourished? That would have required \nmany of the social forces of the time to \nhave been different \u2014including the \nprevailing belief that slavery was natural \nand right. But what if that light that \ndawned in  the eastern Mediterranean \n2,500 years ago had not flickered out? \nWhat if science and the experimental \nmethod and the dignity of crafts and \nmechanical arts had been vigorously \npursued 2,000 years before the Industrial \nRevolution? What if the power of this \nnew mode of thought had been more \ngenerally appreciated? I sometimes think \nwe might then have saved ten or twenty centuries. Perhaps the contributions of Leonardo would have been \nmade a thousand years ago and those of Albert Einstein five \nhundred years ago . In such an alternate Earth, Leonardo and \nEinstein would, of course, never have been born. Too many things \nwould have been different. In every ejaculation there are hundreds \nof millions of sperm cells, only one of which can fertilize an egg and \nproduce a member of the next generation of human beings. But \nwhich sperm succeeds in fertilizing an egg must depend on the most \nminor and insignificant of factors, both internal and external.

The masses of the planets are shown in  units of the Earth\u2019s \nmass. Terrestrial planets are portrayed as filled circles, jovian planets as \nempty circles. Systems A and C are very similar to our own, with terrestrial \nplanets close to the star, and jovian planets farther away. System D has the \nopposite arrangement. Terrestrial and jovian planets are interspersed in E \nand F. Very massive jovian planets are produced in G, and in H the fifth \nplanet is so massive that it has become a star, and the configuration has \nbecome a double star system.

Stars are \nso bright that their planets would ordinarily \nbe totally lost in their glare.  \n \nAs the starlight is artificially eclipsed by a \nforeground occulting disk (or the lunar \nsurface), the planet, shining by reflected \nlight, becomes more easily seen.  \n As the star is totally occulted, the planet emerges from the glare. Repeated \nsuch observations could determine the position, motion and perhaps other \nproperties of the previously undiscovered planet.  \n2,500 years ago, none of us would be here today. There would be \nbillions of others living in our place.  \nIf the Ionian spirit had won, I think we \u2014a different \u201cwe,\u201d of course \u2014\nmight by now be venturing to the stars. Our first survey ships to Alpha \nCentauri and Barnard\u2019s Star, Sirius and Tau Ceti would have returned \nlong ago. Great fleets of interstellar transpo rts would be under \nconstruction in Earth orbit \u2014unmanned survey ships, liners for \nimmigrants, immense trading ships to plow the seas of space. On all \nthese ships there would be symbols and writing. If we looked closely, \nwe might see that the language was Gr eek. And perhaps the symbol \non the bow of one of the first starships would be a dodecahedron, with \nthe inscription \u201cStarship Theodorus of the Planet Earth.\u201d  \nIn the time line of our world, things have gone somewhat more \nslowly. We are not yet ready for the stars. But perhaps in another \ncentury or two, when the solar system is all explored, we will also have \nput our planet in order. We will have the will and the  resources and \nthe technical knowledge to go to the stars. We will have examined \nfrom great distances the diversity of other planetary systems, some very \nmuch like our own and some extremely different. We will know which \nstars to visit. Our machines and ou r descendants will then skim the \nlight years, the children of Thales and Aristarchus, Leonardo and \nEinstein.  \nWe are not yet certain how many planetary systems there are, but \nthere seem to be a great abundance. In our immediate vicinity, there \nis not just one, but in a sense four: Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus each \nhas a satellite system that, in the relative sizes a nd spacings of the \nmoons, resembles closely the planets about the Sun. Extrapolation of \nthe statistics of double stars which are greatly disparate in mass \nsuggests that almost all single stars like the Sun should have planetary \ncompanions.  \nWe cannot yet directly see the planets of other stars, tiny points of \nlight swamped in the brilliance of their local suns. But we are \nbecoming able to detect the gravitational influence of an unseen \nplanet on an observed star. Imagine such a star with a la rge \u201cproper \nmotion,\u201d moving over decades against the backdrop of more distant \nconstellations; and with a large planet, the mass of Jupiter, say, whose \norbital plane is by chance aligned at right angles to our line of sight. \nWhen the dark planet is, from ou r perspective, to the right of the star, \nthe star will be pulled a little to the right, and conversely when the \nplanet is to the left. Consequently, the path of the star will be altered, \nor perturbed, from a straight line to a wavy one. The nearest star fo r \nwhich this gravitational perturbation method can be applied is \n \nBarnard\u2019s Star, the nearest single star. The \ncomplex interactions of the three stars in \nthe Alpha Centauri system would make the \nsearch for a low -mass companion there very \ndifficult. Even for Barnard\u2019s Star, the \ninvestigation must be painstaking, a search \nfor microscopic displacements of position \non photographic plates exposed  369 \nTravels in Space and Time  \u2014  \nat the telescope over a period of decades. Two such quests have  \nbeen performed for planets around Barnard\u2019s Star, and both have \nbeen by some criteria successful, implying the presence of two or more \nplanets of Jovian mass moving in an orbit (calculated by Kepler\u2019s third \nlaw) somewhat closer to their star than Jupiter a nd Saturn are to the \nSun. But unfortunately the two sets of observations seem mutually \nincompatible. A planetary system around Barnard\u2019s Star may well have \nbeen discovered, but an unambiguous demonstration awaits further \nstudy.  \nOther methods of detecting planets around the stars are under \ndevelopment, including one where the obscuring light from the  \nstar is artificially occulted \u2014with a disk in front of a space telescope, or \nby using the dark edge of the Moon as such a disk \u2014and the reflected \nlight from the planet, no longer hidden by the brightness of the nearby \nstar, emerges. In the next few decades w e should have definitive \nanswers to which of the hundred nearest stars have large planetary \ncompanions.  \nIn recent years, infrared observations have revealed a number of \nlikely preplanetary disk -shaped clouds of gas and dust around some of \nthe nearby stars. Meanwhile, some provocative theoretical studies have \nsuggested that planetary systems are a galactic co mmonplace. A set of \ncomputer investigations has examined the evolution of a flat, \ncondensing disk of gas and dust of the sort that is thought to lead to stars and planets. Small lumps of \nmatter \u2014the first condensations in the \ndisk\u2014are injected at random ti mes into \nthe cloud. The lumps accrete dust \nparticles as they move. When they \nbecome sizable, they also gravitationally \nattract gas, mainly hydrogen, in the \ncloud.

Painting \nby David Egge, 1978.  \n \n212 \u2014 Cosmos  \nlumps collide, the computer program makes them stick. The process \ncontinues until all the gas and dust has been in this way used up. The \nresults depend on the initial conditions, particularly on the \ndistribution of gas and dust density with distance from t he center of \nthe cloud. But for a range of plausible initial conditions, planetary \nsystems \u2014about ten planets, terrestrials close to the star, Jovians on the \nexterior \u2014recognizably like ours are generated. Under other \ncircumstances, there are no planets \u2014just a smattering of asteroids; or \nthere may be Jovian planets near the star; or a Jovian planet may \naccrete so much gas and dust as to become a star, the origin of a binary \nstar system. It is still too early to be  \nsure, but it seems that a splendid variety of planetary systems is to be \nfound throughout the Galaxy, and with high frequency \u2014all stars must \ncome, we think, from such clouds of gas and dust. There may be a \nhundred billion planetary systems in the Galaxy aw aiting exploration.  \nNot one of those worlds will be identical to Earth. A few will be \nhospitable; most will appear hostile. Many will be achingly beautiful. \nIn some worlds there will be many suns in the daytime sky, many \nmoons in the heavens at night, or great particle ring s ystems soaring \nfrom horizon to horizon. Some moons will be so close that their planet \nwill loom high in the heavens, covering half the sky. And some worlds \nwill look out onto a vast gaseous nebula, the remains of an ordinary \nstar that once was and is no  \nlonger. In all those skies, rich in distant and exotic constellations, \nthere will be a faint yellow star \u2014perhaps barely seen by the naked eye, \nperhaps visible only through the telescope \u2014the home star of the fleet \nof interstellar transports exploring this t iny region of the great Milky \nWay Galaxy.  \nThe themes of space and time are, as we have seen, intertwined. \nWorlds and stars, like people, are born, live and die. The lifetime of a \nhuman being is measured in decades; the lifetime of the Sun is a \nhundred million times longer. Compared to a star, we a re like \nmayflies, fleeting ephemeral creatures who live out their whole lives in \nthe course of a single day. From the point of view of a mayfly, human \nbeings are stolid, boring, almost entirely immovable, offering hardly a \nhint that they ever do anything. From the point of view of a star, a \nhuman being is a tiny flash, one of billions of brief lives flickering \ntenuously on the suface of a strangely cold, anomalously solid, \nexotically remote sphere of silicate and iron.  \nIn all those other worlds in space there are events in progress, \noccurrences that will determine their futures. And on our small \nplanet, this moment in history is a historical branch point as profound  \nas the confrontation of the Ionian scientists with the mystics 2,500 \nyears ago. What we do with our world in this time will propagate down \nthrough the centuries and powerfully determine the destiny of our \ndescendants and their fate, if any, among the stars . 372 \nTravels in Space and Time  \u2014  373 \n \n374 \nAn airless planet in a binary star system.

The ingredients are made of \nmolecules \u2014sugar, say, or water. The molecules, in turn, are made of \natoms \u2014carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and a few others. Where do these \natoms come from? E xcept for hydrogen, they are all made in stars. A \nstar is a kind of cosmic kitchen inside which atoms of hydrogen are \ncooked into heavier atoms. Stars condense from interstellar gas and \ndust, which are composed mostly of hydrogen. But t he hydrogen was \nmade in the Big Bang, the explosion that began the Cosmos. If you \nwish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the \nuniverse.  \nSuppose you take an apple pie and cut it in half; take one of the two \npieces, cut it in half; and, in the spirit of Democritus, con - tinue. How \nmany cuts before you are down to a single atom? The answer is about \nninety successive cuts. Of course, no knife could be sharp enough, the \npie is too crumbly, and the atom would in any case be too small to see \nunaided. But there is a way to do it.  \nAt Cambridge University in England, in the forty -five years centered \non 1910, the nature of the atom was first understood \u2014 partly by \nshooting pieces of atoms at atoms and watching how they bounce off. \nA typical atom has a kind of cloud of electrons on the outside. \nElectrons are electrically charged, as their name suggests. The charge \nis arbitrarily called negative. Electrons de - termine the chemical \nproperties of the atom \u2014the glitter of gold, the cold feel of iron, the \ncrystal structure of the carbon diamon d. Deep inside the atom, hidden \nfar beneath the electron cloud, is the nucleus, generally composed of \npositively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons. Atoms are \nvery small \u2014one hundred million of them end to end would be as large \nas the tip of your little finger. But the nucleus is a hundred thousand \ntimes smaller still, which is part of the reason it took so long to be \ndiscovered.* Nevertheless, most of the mass of an atom is in its \nnucleus; the electrons are by comparison just clouds of moving  fluff. \nAtoms are mainly empty space. Matter is composed chiefly of nothing.  \nI am made of atoms. My elbow, which is resting on the table before \nme, is made of atoms. The table is made of atoms. But if atoms are so \nsmall and empty and the nuclei smaller still, why does the table hold \nme up? Why, as Arthur Eddington liked to ask, do the nuclei that \ncomprise my elbow not slide effortlessly  \n*It had previously been thought that the protons were uniformly \ndistributed throughout the electron cloud, rather than being concentrated \nin a nucleus of positive charge at the center. The nucleus was discovered \nby Ernest Rutherford at Cambridge when some of the bombarding \nparticles were bounced back in the direction from which they had come. \nRutherford commented: \u201cIt was quite the most incredible event that has \never happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired \n \na 15-inch [cannon] shell at a piece of tissue \npaper and it came back and hit you.\u201d   \nThe Lives of the Stars \u2014 219 \nthrough the nuclei that comprise the table? Why don\u2019t I wind up on the \nfloor? Or fall straight through the Earth?  \nThe answer is the electron cloud. The outside of an atom in my \nelbow has a negative electrical charge. So does every atom in the table. \nBut negative charges repel each other. My elbow does not slither \nthrough the table because atoms have electrons around t heir nuclei \nand because electrical forces are strong. Everyday life depends on the \nstructure of the atom. Turn off the electrical charges and everything \ncrumbles to an invisible fine dust. Without electrical forces, there \nwould no longer be things in the u niverse \u2014merely diffuse clouds of \nelectrons, protons and neutrons, and gravitating spheres of \nelementary particles, the featureless remnants of worlds.  \nWhen we consider cutting an apple pie, continuing down beyond \na single atom, we confront an infinity of the very small. And when we \nlook up at the night sky, we confront an infinity of the very large. \nThese infinities represent an unending regress that goe s on not just \nvery far, but forever. If you stand between two mirrors \u2014in a barber \nshop, say \u2014you see a large number of images of yourself, each the \nreflection of another. You cannot see an infinity of images because the \nmirrors are not perfectly flat and al igned, because light does not travel \ninfinitely fast, and because you are in the way. When we talk about \ninfinity we are talking  \nabout a quantity greater than any number, no matter how large.  \nThe American mathematician Edward Kasner once asked his nine -\nyear-old nephew to invent a name for an extremely large number \u2014ten \nto the power one hundred (10100), a one followed by a hundred zeroes. \nThe boy called it a googol. Here it is:  \n10, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,  \n000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, \n000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000. You, too, can make up your own very \nlarge numbers and give them strange names. Try it. It has a certain \ncharm, especially if you happen to be nine.  \nIf a googol seems large, consider a googolplex. It is ten to the power \nof a googol \u2014that is, a one followed by a googol zeros. By comparison, \nthe total number of atoms in your body is about 1028, and the total \nnumber of elementary particles \u2014protons and neutrons and electrons \u2014\nin the observable universe is about 1080. If the universe were packed \nsolid* with neutrons, say, so there  \n \n* The spirit of this calculation is very old. The opening sentences of \nArchimedes\u2019 The Sand Reckoner  are: \u201cThere are some, King Gelon, who think \nthat the number of the sand is infinite in multitude: and I mean by the sand \n \nnot only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily, but also that \nwhich is found in every region, whether inhabited or uninhabited. And again, \nthere are some who, without regarding it as infinite, yet think that no number \nhas been named which  is great enough  \nto exceed its multitude.\u201d Archimedes then went on not only to name the number but \nto calculate it. Later he asked how many grains of sand  \nwould fit, side by side, into the universe that he knew. His estimate: 1063, which \ncorresponds, by a curious coincidence, to 1083 or so atoms.  386 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nAtoms of the mineral marcasite, magnified \n4-5 million times with a microscope \nemploying both visible light and X -rays. \nMarcasite is a crystal in which the unit  \nFeS 2 is repeated, Fe standing for iron and \nrepresented by the large spots, S standing \nfor sulfur and represented by the pair of small spots flanking each iron atom.

And yet these numbers, the googol and the \ngoogolplex, do not approach, they come nowhere near, the idea of \ninfinity. A googolplex is precisely as far from infini ty as is the number \none. We could try to write out a googolplex, but it is a forlorn \nambition. A piece of paper large enough to have all the zeroes in a \ngoogolplex written out explicitly cou ld not be stuffed into the known \nuniverse. Happily, there is a simpler and very concise way of writing a \ngoogolplex: 1010100; and even infinity: \u221e (pronounced \u201cinfinity\u201d).  \nIn a burnt apple pie, the char is mostly carbon. Ninety cuts and you \ncome to a carbon atom, with six protons and six neutrons in its \nnucleus and six electrons in the exterior cloud. If we were to pull a \nchunk out of the nucleus \u2014say, one with two protons an d two \nneutrons \u2014it would be not the nucleus of a carbon atom, but the \nnucleus of a helium atom. Such a cutting or fission of atomic nuclei \noccurs in nuclear weapons and conventional nuclear power plants, \nalthough it is not carbon that is split. If you make the ninety -first cut \nof the apple pie, if you slice a carbon nucleus, you make not a smaller \npiece of carbon, but something else \u2014an atom with completely different \nchemical properties. If you cut an atom, you transmute the elements.  \nBut suppose we go farther. Atoms are made of protons, neutrons \nand electrons. Can we cut a proton? If we bombard protons at high \nenergies with other elementary particles \u2014other protons, say \u2014we begin \nto glimpse more fundamental units hiding inside the proton . \nPhysicists now propose that so -called elementary particles such as \nprotons and neutrons are in fact made of still more elementary \nparticles called quarks, which come in a variety of \u201ccolors\u201d and \n\u201cflavors,\u201d as their properties have been termed in a poigna nt attempt \nto make the subnuclear world a little more like home. Are quarks the \nultimate constituents of matter, or are they too composed of still \nsmaller and more elementary particles? Will we ever come to an end \nin our understanding of the nature of matt er, or is there an infinite \nregression into more and more fundamental particles? This is one of \nthe great unsolved prob-  \nlems in science.  \nThe transmutation of the elements was pursued in medieval \nlaboratories in a quest called alchemy. Many alchemists believed that \nall matter was a mixture of four elementary substances: water, air, earth \nand fire, an ancient Ionian speculation. By altering t he relative \nproportions of earth and fire, say, you would be able, they thought, to \nchange copper into gold. The field swarmed with charming frauds and \ncon men, such as Cagliostro and the Count of Saint -Germain, who \n387 \u2014 Cosmos  \npretended not only to transmute the \nelements but also to hold the secret of \nimmortality. Sometimes gold was hidden \nin a wand with a false bottom, to appear \nmiraculously in a crucible at the end of \nsome arduous  388 \u2014 Cosmos  \nThe Lives of the Stars \u2014  \nexperimental demonstration. With wealth and immortality the  \nbait, the European nobility found itself transferring large sums to the \npractitioners of this dubious art. But there were more serious \nalchemists such as Paracelsus and even Isaac Newton. The money was \nnot altogether wasted \u2014new chemical elements, such as p hosphorus, \nantimony and mercury, were discovered. In fact, the origin of modern \nchemistry can be traced directly to these experiments.  \nThere are ninety -two chemically distinct kinds of naturally \noccurring atoms. They are called the chemical elements and until \nrecently constituted everything on our planet, although they are \nmainly found combined into molecules. Water is a molecule made of \nhydrogen and oxygen atoms. Air is made mostly of the atoms nitrogen \n(N), oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and argon (Ar), in the \nmolecular forms N 2, O 2, CO 2, H 2O and Ar. The Earth itself is a very \nrich mixture of atoms, mostly silicon,* oxygen, aluminu m, magnesium \nand iron. Fire is not made of chemical elements at all. It is a radiating \nplasma in which the high temperature has stripped some of the \nelectrons from their nuclei. Not one of the four ancient Ionian and \nalchemical \u201celements\u201d is in the modern sense an element at all: one is \na molecule, two are mixtures of molecules, and the last is a plasma.  \nSince the time of the alchemists, more and more elements have \nbeen discovered, the latest to be found tending to be the rarest. Many \nare familiar \u2014those that primarily make up the Earth; or those \nfundamental to life. Some are solids, some gases, and two (br omine \nand mercury) are liquids at room temperature.  \nScientists conventionally arrange them in order of complexity. The \nsimplest, hydrogen, is element 1; the most complex, uranium, is \nelement 92. Other elements are less familiar \u2014hafnium, erbium, \ndyprosium and praseodymium, say, which we do not much bump into  \nin everyday life. By and large, the more familiar an element is, the more \nabundant it is. The Earth contains a great deal of iron and rather little \nyttrium. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, such as gold or \nuranium, elements prized because of  arbitrary economic conventions \nor aesthetic judgments, or because they have remarkable practical \napplications.  \nThe fact that atoms are composed of three kinds of elementary \nparticles \u2014protons, neutrons and electrons \u2014is a comparatively recent finding. The neutron was not discovered \nuntil 1932. Modern physics and \nchemistry have reduced the complexity \nof the sensible world to an astonishing \nsimplicity: three units put together in \nvarious patterns make, essentially, \neverything.  \nThe neutrons, as we have said and as \ntheir name suggests, carry no electrical \ncharge. The protons have a positive \ncharge and the electrons an eaual \nnegative charge. The attraction between  \n* Silicon is an atom.

Since each atom is electrically neutral, the number of protons \nin the nucleus must exactly equal the number of electrons in the \nelectron cloud. The chemistry of an atom depends on ly on the number \nof electrons, which equals the number of protons, and which is called \nthe atomic number. Chemistry is simply numbers, an idea Pythagoras \nwould have liked. If you are an atom with one proton, you are \nhydrogen; two, helium; three, lithium; f our, beryllium; five, boron; six, \ncarbon; seven, nitrogen; eight, oxygen; and so on, up to 92 protons, in \nwhich case your name is uranium.  \nLike charges, charges of the same sign, strongly repel one another. \nWe can think of it as a dedicated mutual aversion to their own kind, \na little as if the world were densely populated by anchorites and \nmisanthropes. Electrons repel electrons. Protons repe l protons. So \nhow can a nucleus stick together? Why does it not instantly fly apart? \nBecause there is another force of nature: not gravity, not electricity, \nbut the short -range nuclear force, which, like a set of hooks that engage \nonly when protons and neu trons come very close together, thereby \novercomes the electrical repulsion among the protons. The neutrons, \nwhich contribute nuclear forces of attraction and no electrical forces \nof repulsion, provide a kind of glue that helps to hold the nucleus \ntogether.  Longing for solitude, the hermits have been chained to their \ngrumpy fellows and set among others given to indiscriminate and \nvoluble amiability.   \n \nClose -up of a sunspot group in red \nhydrogen light.

Three helium \nnuclei make a carbon nucleus; four, \noxygen; five, neon; six, magnesium; \nseven, silicon; eight, sulfur; and so on. \nEvery time we add one or more p rotons \nand enough neutrons to keep the \nnucleus together, we make a new \nchemical element. If we subtract one proton and three neutrons from mercury, we make gold, the dream of \nthe ancient alchemists. Beyond uranium there are other elements that \ndo not natu rally occur on Earth. They are synthesized by human \nbeings and in most cases promptly fall to pieces. One of them, Element \n94, is called plutonium and is one of the most toxic substances known. \nUnfortunately, it falls to pieces rather slowly.  \nWhere do the naturally occurring elements come from? We might \ncontemplate a separate creation of each atomic species. But the \nuniverse, all of it, almost everywhere, is 99 percent hydrogen and \nhelium,* the two simplest elements. Helium, in fact, was  \n \n*The Earth is an exception, because our primordial hydrogen, only weakly \nbound by our planet\u2019s comparatively feeble gravitational attraction, has by \nnow largely escaped to space.

Might the other chemical \nelements have somehow evolved from hydrogen and helium? To \nbalance the electrical repulsion, pieces of nuclear matter wou ld have \nto be brought very close together so that the short -range nuclear forces \nare engaged. This can happen only at very high temperatures where \nthe particles are moving so fast that the repulsive force does not have \ntime to act \u2014temperatures of tens of m illions of degrees. In nature, such \nhigh temperatures and attendant high pressures are common only in \nthe insides of the stars.  \nWe have examined our Sun, the nearest star, in various wavelengths \nfrom radio waves to ordinary visible light to X -rays, all of which arise \nonly from its outermost layers. It is not exactly a  \nred-hot stone, as Anaxagoras thought, but rather a great ball of \nhydrogen and helium gas, glowing because of its high temperatures, in \nthe same way that a poker glows when it is brought to red heat. \nAnaxagoras was at least partly right. Violent solar storm s produce \nbrilliant flares that disrupt radio communications on Earth; and \nimmense arching plumes of hot gas, guided by the Sun\u2019s magnetic \nfield, the solar prominences, which dwarf the Earth. The sunspots, \nsometimes visible to the naked eye at sunset, are cooler regions of \nenhanced magnetic field strength. All this incessant, roiling, turbulent \nactivity is in the comparatively cool visible surface. We see only to \ntemperatures of about 6,000 degrees. But the hidden interior of the \nSun, where sunlight is bein g generated, is at 40 million degrees.  \nStars and their accompanying planets are born in the gravitational \ncollapse of a cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The collision of the gas \nmolecules in the interior of the cloud heats it, eventually to the point \nwhere hydrogen begins to fuse into helium : four hydrogen nuclei \ncombine to form a helium nucleus, with an attendant release of a \ngamma -ray photon. Suffering alternate absorption and emission by the \noverlying matter, gradually working its way toward the surface of the \nstar, losing energy at every step, the photon\u2019s epic journey takes a \nmillion years until, as visible light, it reaches the surface and is radiated \nto space. The star has turned on. The gravitational collapse of the \nprestellar cloud has been halted. The weight of the outer layers of th e \nstar is now supported by the high temperatures and pressures \ngenerated in the interior nuclear reactions. The Sun has been in such \na stable situation for the past five billion years. Thermonuclear \nreactions like those in a hydrogen bomb are powering the Sun in a \ncontained and continuous explosion, converting some four hundred \nmillion tons (4 \u00d7 1014 grams) of hydrogen into helium every second. 395 \nWhen we look up at night and view the stars, everything we see is \nshining because of distant nuclear fusion.  \nIn the direction of the star Deneb, in the constellation of  396 \u2014 Cosmos  \nLoops of hot ionized gas above an active solar \nregion are constrained to follow the local \nmagnetic lines of force, like iron filings in the \nheld of a bar magnet.

In this sense, stars have \nparents; and, as is sometimes also true for humans, a parent may die in the birth of the child.  \nStars like the Sun are born in batches, in great compressed cloud \ncomplexes such as the Orion Nebula. Seen from the outside, such \nclouds seem dark and gloomy. But inside, they are brilliantly \nilluminated by the hot newborn stars (p. 230). Later, the stars wander \nout of their nursery to seek their fortunes in the Milky Way, stellar \nadolescents still surrounded by tufts of glowing nebulosity, residues \nstill gravitationally attached of their am - niotic gas. The Pleiades (p. \n231) are a nearby example. As in the  families of humans, the maturing \nstars journey far from home, and the siblings see little of each other. \nSomewhere in the Galaxy there are stars \u2014perhaps dozens of them \u2014\nthat are the brothers and sisters of the Sun, formed from the same \ncloud complex, some 5 billion years ago.

But neutrinos are not \nphotons. They are not a kind of light. Neu - trinos have the same \nintrinsic angular momentum, or spin, as protons, electrons and \nneutrons; while photons have twice as much spin. Matter is \ntransparent to neutrinos, which pass almost effort - lessly through the \nEarth and through the Sun. Only a tiny fract ion of them is stopped \nby the intervening matter.

Of course, they are not stopped at the retina as ordinary photons are but continue \nunmolested through the back of my head. The curious part is that if at \nnight I look down at the ground, toward the place where the Sun \nwould be (if the Earth were not in the way), almost exactly the same \nnumber of solar neutrinos pass through my eyeball, p ouring through \nan interposed Earth which is as transparent to neutrinos as a pane of \nclear glass is to visible  light.  \nIf our knowledge of the solar interior is as complete as we think, \nand if we also understand the nuclear physics that makes neutrinos, \nthen we should be able to calculate with fair accuracy how many solar \nneutrinos we should receive in a given area - such a s my eyeball \u2014in a \ngiven unit of time, such as a second. Experimental confirmation of the \ncalculation is much more difficult. Since neutrinos pass directly \nthrough the Earth, we cannot catch a given one. But for a vast number \nof neutrinos, a small fraction will interact with matter and in the \nappropriate circumstances might be detected. Neutrinos can on rare \noccasion convert chlorine atoms into argon atoms, with the same total \nnumber of protons and neutrons. To detect the predicted solar \nneutrino flux, you n eed an immense amount of chlorine, so American \nphysicists have poured a huge quantity of cleaning fluid into the \nHomestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota. The chlorine is \nmicrochemically swept for the newly produced argon. The more argon \nfound, the more neutri nos inferred. These experiments imply that the \nSun is dimmer in neutrinos than the calculations predict.  \nThere is a real and unsolved mystery here. The low solar neutrino \nflux probably does not put our view of stellar nucleosynthesis in \njeopardy, but it surely means something important. Proposed \nexplanations range from the hypothesis that neutrinos fall to pi eces \nduring their passage between the Sun and the Earth to the idea that \nthe nuclear fires in the solar interior are temporarily banked, sunlight \nbeing generated in our time partly by slow gravitational contraction. \nBut neutrino astronomy is very new. For the moment we stand amazed \nat having created a tool that can peer directly into the blazing heart of \nthe Sun. As the sensitivity of the neutrino telescope improves, it may \nbecome possible to probe nuclear fusion in the deep interiors of the \nnearby stars.  \n \nBut hydrogen fusion cannot continue forever: in the Sun or any \nother star, there is only so much hydrogen fuel in its hot interior. The \nfate of a star, the end of its life cycle, depends very much on its initial \nmass. If, after whatever matter it has lost to space, a star retains two or \nthree times the mass of the Sun, it ends its life cycle in a startlingly \ndifferent mode than the Sun. But the Sun\u2019s fate is spectacular enough. \nWhen the central hydrogen has all reacted to form helium, five or six \nbillion ye ars from now, the zone of hydrogen fusion will slowly migrate \noutward, an expanding shell of thermonuclear reactions, until it \nreaches the place where the temperatures are less than about ten \nmillion degrees. Then hydrogen fusion will shut itself off. Mean while \nthe self -gravity of the Sun will force a renewed contraction of its \nhelium -rich core and a further increase in its interior temperatures \nand pressures. The helium nuclei will be jammed together still more \ntightly, so much so that they begin to stick together, the hooks of their \nshort -range nuclear forces becoming engaged de-  \nspite the mutual electrical repulsion. The ash will become fuel, and \nthe Sun will be triggered into a second round of fusion  \nreactions.  \nThis process will generate the elements carbon and oxygen and \nprovide additional energy for the Sun to continue shining for a limited \ntime. A star is a phoenix, destined to rise for a time from its own \nashes.* Under the combined influence of hydrogen fusio n in a thin \nshell far from the solar interior and the high temperature helium \nfusion in the core, the Sun will undergo a major change: its exterior \nwill expand and cool. The Sun will become a red giant star, its visible \nsurface so tar from its interior tha t the gravity at its surface grows \nfeeble, its atmosphere expanding into space in a kind of stellar gale. \nWhen the Sun, ruddy and bloated, becomes a red giant, it will envelop \nand devour the planets Mercury and Venus \u2014and probably the Earth \nas well. The inn er solar system will then reside within the Sun.  \nBillions of years from now, there will be a last perfect day on  \nEarth. Thereafter the Sun will slowly become red and distended, \npresiding over an Earth sweltering even at the poles. The Arctic and \nAntarctic icecaps will melt, flooding the coasts of the. world. The high \noceanic temperatures will release more water vapor  into the air, \nincreasing cloudiness, shielding the Earth from sunlight and delaying \nthe end a little. But solar evolution is inexorable. Eventually the \noceans will boil, the atmosphere will evaporate away to space and a \ncatastrophe of the most immense pro portions imaginable will \novertake our planet.9 In the meantime,  \n \n9 The Aztecs foretold a time \u201cwhen the Earth has become tired . . . , when \nthe seed of Earth has ended.\u201d On that day, they believed, the Sun will \nfall from the sky and the stars will be shaken from the heavens.   \n* Stars more massive than the Sun achieve \nhigher central temperatures and pressures \nin their late evolutionary stages. They are \nable to rise more than once from their \nashes, using carbon and oxygen as fuel for \nsynthesizing still heavier elements.  \nThe Lives of the Stars  \u2014 231 \n \nThe Pleiades in the constellation Taurus, \nfirst examined through the telescope by \nGalileo.

Perhaps our descendants will be able to control or moderate \nstellar evolution. Or perhaps they will merely pick up and leave for \nMars or Europa or Titan or, at last, as Robert Goddard envisioned, \nseek out an uninhabited planet in some young and promising \nplanetary system.  \nThe Sun\u2019s stellar ash can be reused for fuel only up to a point. \nEventually the time will come when the solar interior is all carbon and \noxygen, when at the prevailing temperatures and pressures no further \nnuclear reactions can occur. After the central hel ium is almost all used \nup, the interior of the Sun will continue its postponed collapse, the \ntemperatures will rise again, triggering a last round of nuclear reactions \nand expanding the solar atmosphere a little. In its death throes, the \nSun will slowly pu lsate, expanding and contracting once every few \nmillennia, eventually spewing its atmosphere into space in one or more \nconcentric shells of gas. The hot exposed solar interior will flood the \nshell with ultraviolet light, inducing a lovely red and blue fluo rescence \nextending beyond the orbit of Pluto. Perhaps half the mass of the Sun \nwill be lost in this way. The solar system will then be filled with an \neerie radiance, the ghost of the Sun, outward bound.  \nWhen we look around us in our little corner of the Milky - Way, we \nsee many stars surrounded by spherical shells of glowing gas, the \nplanetary nebulae. (They have nothing to do with planets, but some of \nthem seemed reminiscent in inferior telescopes of the blue-green discs \nof Uranus and Neptune.) They appear as rings, but only because, as \nwith soap bubbles, we see more of them at the periphery than at the \ncenter. Every planetary nebula is a token of a star in extremis. Near the \ncentral star there may be a re tinue of dead worlds, the remnants of \nplanets once full of life and now airless and ocean -free, bathed in a \nwraithlike luminance. The remains of the Sun, the exposed solar core \nat first enveloped in its planetary nebula, will be a small hot star, \ncooling t o space, collapsed to a density unheard of on Earth, more \nthan a ton per teaspoonful. Billions of years hence, the Sun will \nbecome a degenerate white dwarf, cooling like all those points of light \nwe see at the centers of planetary nebulae from high surface  \ntemperatures to its ultimate state, a dark and dead black dwarf.  \nTwo stars of roughly the same mass will evolve roughly in parallel. \nBut a more massive star will spend its nuclear fuel faster, become a red \ngiant sooner, and be first to enter the final white dwarf decline. There \nshould therefore be, as there are, many ca ses of binary stars, one \ncomponent a red giant, the other a white dwarf. Some such pairs are \nso close together that they touch, and the glowing stellar atmosphere \nflows from the distended red giant to the compact white dwarf, \nThe Lives of the Stars \u2014 233 \naccumulates,  compressed  to  higher  and  higher  pressures  406 \u2014 Cosmos  \ntending to fall on a particular province of \nthe surface of the white dwarf.

Such a binary is called a nova \nand has quite a different origin from a \nsupernova. Novae occur only in binary \nsystems and are powered by hydrogen \nfusion; supernovae occur in single stars \nand are powered by silicon fusion.  \nAtoms synthesized in the interiors of \nstars are commonly returned to the \ninterstellar gas. Red giants find their \nouter atmospheres blowing away into \nspace; planetary nebulae are the final \nstages of Sunlike stars blowing their tops. \nSupernovae violently eje ct much of their \nstellar mass into space. The atoms \nreturned are, naturally, those most \nreadily made in the thermonuclear \nreactions in stellar interiors: Hydrogen \nfuses into helium, helium into carbon, \ncarbon into oxygen and thereafter, in \nmassive stars, b y the successive addition \nof further helium nuclei, neon, \nmagnesium, silicon, sulfur, and so on are \nbuilt\u2014additions by stages, two protons \nand two neutrons per stage, all the way \nto iron. Direct fusion of silicon also \ngenerates iron, a pair of silicon atom s, \neach with twenty -eight protons and \nneutrons, joining, at a temperature of \nbillions of degrees, to make an atom of \niron with fifty -six protons and neutrons.  \nThese are all familiar chemical \nelements. We recognize their names. \nSuch stellar nuclear reactions do not \nreadily generate erbium, hafnium, \ndyprosium, praseodymium or yttrium, \nbut rather the elements we know in \neveryday life, elements returned to the \ninter stellar gas, where they are swept up \nin a subsequent  \ngeneration of cloud collapse and star \nand planet formation. All the elements of the Earth except hydrogen and some helium have been cooked by \na kind of stellar alchemy billions of years ago in stars, some of which \nare today inconspicuous white dwarfs on the other side of the Milky \nWay Galaxy. The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in  our teeth, the \niron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the \ninteriors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.  \nSome of the rarer elements are generated in the supernova \nexplosion itself. We have relatively abundant gold and uranium on \nEarth only because many supernova explosions had occurred just \nbefore the solar system formed. Other planetary systems may have \nsome what different amounts of our rare elements. Are there planets \nwhere the inhabitants proudly display pendants of niobium and \nbracelets of protactinium, while gold is a laboratory curiosity? Would \nour lives be improved if gold and uranium were as obscure an d \nunimportant on Earth as praseodymium?  \nThe origin and evolution of life are connected in the most intimate \nway with the origin and evolution of the stars. First: The very matter \nof which we are composed, the atoms that make life possible, were \ngenerated long ago and far away in giant red stars.   \n \nThe Crab Nebula in Taurus, 6,000 light - years distant; it is the remains of the \nsupernova explosion witnessed in the year 1054 on Earth.

Of the \nremaining counts, a traction come from natural radioactivity in the \nwalls of the cave. But there are more clicks than can be accounted for \nby radioactivity. Some of them are caused by high -energy charged \nparticles penetrating the roof. We are listening to cosmic rays, \nproduced in another age in the depths of space.

Alice, the  \nMarch Hare, the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat from Lewis \nCarroll\u2019s Alice in Wonderland  enjoy a tea party under ordinary \nEarth gravity (a) of 1 g. The light beam from the lantern at right \nis undeflected by the Earth\u2019s gravity. As we approach 0 g, the \nslightest motion sends our friends pirouetting off into space ( b, \nc); the tea forms itself into floating spherical blobs. As we return \nto 1 g, Alice and companions are brought back to Earth, and, \nbriefly, it is raining tea (d). At several g\u2019s, they are unable  \ndeven to move themselves a little (e, f), but the beam of light is \nunaffected. By the time we reach 100,000 g\u2019s, the entire \nlandscape is crushed flat. At a billion g\u2019s, gravity \nperceptibly bends light, and at billions of g\u2019s, light falls \n \nback to the ground. At that point, the intense gravity has \nconverted Wonderland into a black hole. Drawings after \nTenniel by Brown.   \nthe sky. Halfway around the world, in the American Southwest, there \nwas then a high culture, rich in astronomical tradition, that  \nalso witnessed this brilliant new star.* From carbon 14 dating of the \nremains of a charcoal fire, we know that in the middle eleventh \ncentury some Anasazi, the antecedents of the Hopi of today, were \nliving under an overhanging ledge in what is today New Me xico. One \nof them seems to have drawn on the cliff overhang, protected from \nthe weather, a picture of the new star. Its position relative to the \ncrescent moon would have been just as was depicted. There is also a \nhandprint, perhaps the artist\u2019s signature.  \nThis remarkable star, 5,000 light -years distant, is now called the \nCrab Supernova, because an astronomer centuries later was \nunaccountably reminded of a crab when looking at the explosion \nremnant through his telescope. The Crab Nebula is the remains of a \nmassive star that blew itself up. The explosion was seen on Earth with \nthe naked eye for three months. Easily visible in broad daylight, you \ncould read by it at night. On the average, a supernova occurs in a \ngiven galaxy about once every century. During the  lifetime of a typical \ngalaxy, about ten billion years, a hundred million stars will have \nexploded \u2014a great many, but still only about one star in a thousand. \nIn the Milky Way, after the event of 1054, there was a supernova \nobserved in 1572, and described b y Tycho Brahe, and another, just \nafter, in 1604, described by Johannes Kepler.10  Unhappily, no \nsupernova explosions have been observed in our Galaxy since the \ninvention of the telescope, and astronomers have been chafing at the \nbit for some centuries.  \nSupernovae are now routinely observed in other galaxies.  \nAmong my candidates for the sentence that would most thoroughly \nastonish an astronomer of the early 1900\u2019s is the following, from a \npaper by David Helfand and Knox Long in the December 6, 1979, \nissue of the British journal Nature: \u201cOn 5  \nMarch, 1979, an extremely intense burst of hard x -rays and gamma \nrays was recorded by the nine interplanetary spacecraft of the burst \nsensor network, and localized by time -of-flight determinations to a \nposition coincident with the supernova remnant N49 in the Large \nMagellanic Cloud.\u201d (The Large Magellanic Cloud,  \n \n* Moslem observers noted it as well.

There is also, as you might expect, a Small \nMagellanic Cloud.) However, in the same issu e of Nature , E. P. Mazets \nand colleagues of the Ioffe Institute, Leningrad \u2014who observed this \nsource with the gamma -ray burst detector aboard the Venera 11 and \n12 spacecraft on their way to land on Venus \u2014argue that what is being \nseen is a flaring pulsar onl y a few hundred light -years away. But despite \nthe close agreement in position Helfand and Long do not insist that \nthe gamma -ray outburst is associated with the supernova remnant. \nThey charitably consider many alternatives, including the surprising \npossibil ity that the source lies within the solar system. Perhaps it is the \nexhaust of an alien starship on its long voyage home. But a rousing of \nthe stellar fires in N49 is a simpler hypothesis: we are sure there are \nsuch things as supernovae.  The fate of the inner solar system as \nthe Sun becomes a red giant is grim \nenough. But at least the planets will \nnever be melted and frizzled by an \nerupting supernova. That is a fate \nreserved for planets near stars more \nmassive than the Sun. Since such star s \nwith higher temperatures and pressures \nrun rapidly through their store of \nnuclear fuel, their lifetimes are much \nshorter than the Sun\u2019s. A star tens of \ntimes more massive than the Sun can \nstably convert hydrogen to helium for \nonly a few million years bef ore moving \nbriefly on to more exotic nuclear \nreactions. Thus there is almost certainly \nnot enough time for the evolution of \nadvanced forms of life on any \naccompanying planets; and it will be \nrare that beings elsewhere can ever \nknow that their star will bec ome a \nsupernova: if they live long enough to \nunderstand supernovae, their star is \nunlikely to become one.  \nThe essential preliminary to a \nsupernova explosion is the generation \nby silicon fusion of a massive iron core. \nUnder enormous pressure, the free \nelectrons in the stellar interior are \nforcibly melded with the protons of the \niron nuclei, the equal and opposi te \nelectrical charges canceling each other \nout; the inside of the star is turned into \na single giant atomic nucleus, \noccupying a much smaller volume than \nthe precursor electrons and iron nuclei. \nThe core implodes violently, the \nexterior rebounds and a supe rnova \nexplosion results. A supernova can be \nbrighter than the combined radiance of \nall the other stars in the galaxy within \nwhich it is embedded. All those recently \nhatched massive blue - white supergiant \nstars in Orion are destined in the next \nfew million years to become \nsupernovae, a continuing cosmic \nfireworks in the constellation of the \nhunter.  \n \nThe awesome supernova explosion ejects into space most of the \nmatter of the precursor star \u2014a little residual hydrogen and helium and \nsignificant amounts of other atoms, carbon and silicon, iron and \nuranium. Remaining is a core of hot neutrons, bound togeth er by \nnuclear forces, a single, massive atomic nucleus   416 \nThe Lives of the Stars  \u2014  \nwith an atomic weight about 1056, a sun thirty kilometers  \nacross; a tiny, shrunken, dense, withered stellar fragment, a rapidly rotating neutron star. As the core of a massive \nred giant collapses to form such a neutron star, it spins faster. The neutron star at the center of the Crab Nebula \nis an immense atomic n ucleus, about the size of Manhattan, spinning thirty times a second. Its powerful magnetic \nfield, amplified during the collapse, traps charged particles rather as the much tinier magnetic field of Jupiter does. \nElectrons in the rotating magnetic field emit  beamed radiation not only at radio frequencies but in visible light as \nwell. If the Earth happens to lie in the beam of this cosmic lighthouse, we see it flash once each rotation. This is \nthe reason it is called a pulsar. Blinking and ticking like a cosmi c metronome, pulsars keep far better time than the \nmost accurate ordinary clock. Long -term timing of the radio pulse rate of some pulsars, for instance, one called \nPSR 0329+54, suggests that these objects may have one or more small planetary companions. It  is perhaps \nconceivable that a planet could survive the evolution of a star into a pulsar; or a planet could be captured at a later \ntime. I wonder how the sky would look from the surface of such a planet.  \nNeutron star matter weighs about the same as an ordinary mountain per teaspoonful \u2014so much that if you had \na piece of it and let it go (you could hardly do otherwise), it might pass effortlessly through the Earth like a falling \nstone through air, carving a hole for itself completely through our planet and emerging out the other side \u2014perhaps \nin China. People there might be out for a stroll, minding their own business, when a tiny lump of neutron star \nplummets out of the ground, hovers for a moment, and then r eturns beneath the Earth, providing at least a \ndiversion from the routine of the day. If a piece of neutron star matter were dropped from nearby space, with the \nEarth rotating  \nbeneath it as it fell, it would plunge repeatedly through the A bas -relief of five -pointed stars from rotating Earth, punching \nhundreds of thousands of holes before pharaonic temple ruins in Dendera, \nEgypt.  \nPhoto by Ann Druyan. \nfriction with the interior of our planet stopped the motion. Before it comes to rest at the center \nof the Earth, the inside of our planet might look briefly like a Swiss cheese until the \nsubterranean flow of rock and metal healed the wounds. It is just as well that large lumps of \nneutron star matter are unknown on Earth. But small lumps are everywhere. The awesome \npower of the neutron star is lurking in the nucleus of every atom, hidden in every teacup and \ndormouse, every breath of air,  every apple pie.  \nThe neutron star teaches us respect for the commonplace.  \nA star like the Sun will end its days, as we have seen, as a red giant \nand then a white dwarf. A collapsing star twice as massive as the Sun \nwill become a supernova and then a neutron star. But a more massive \n 417 \nstar, left, after its supernova phase, with, say, five times the Sun\u2019s mass, \nhas an even more remarkable fate reserved for it \u2014its gravity will turn \nit into a black hole.

Photographs by the author.  \nmagic gravity machine \u2014a device with \nwhich we could control the Earth\u2019s \ngravity, perhaps by turning a dial. \nInitially the dial is set at 1 g* and \neverything behaves as we have grown up to expect. The animals and plants on Earth and the structures of our \nbuildings are all evolved or designed for 1 g. If the gravity were much \nless, there might be tall, spindly shapes that would not be tumbled or \ncrushed by their own weight. If the gravity were much more, plants \nand animals and architecture would have to be sho rt and squat and \nsturdy in order not to collapse. But even in a fairly strong gravity field, \nlight would travel in a straight line,  \nas it does, of course, in everyday life.  \nConsider (page 236) a possibly typical group of Earth beings. As we \nlower the gravity, things weigh less. Near 0 g the slightest motion sends \nour friends floating and tumbling up in the air. Spilled tea \u2014or any \nother liquid \u2014forms throbbing spherical globs i n the air: the surface \ntension of the liquid overwhelms gravity. Balls of tea are everywhere. \nIf now we dial 1 g again, we make a rain of tea. When we increase the \ngravity a little \u2014from 1 g to, say, 3 or 4 g\u2019s \u2014everyone becomes \nimmobilized: even moving a pa w requires enormous effort. As a \nkindness we remove our friends from the domain of the gravity \nmachine before we dial higher gravities still. The beam from a lantern \ntravels in a perfectly straight line (as nearly as we can see) at a few g\u2019s, \nas it does at  0 g. At 1000 g\u2019s, the beam is still straight, but trees have \nbecome squashed and flattened; at 100,000 g\u2019s, rocks are crushed by \ntheir own weight. Eventually, nothing at all survives except, through a \nspecial dispensation, the Cheshire cat. When the gravi ty approaches a \nbillion g\u2019s, something still more strange happens. The beam of light, \nwhich has until now been heading straight up into the sky, is beginning \nto bend. Under extremely strong gravitational accelerations, even light \nis affected. If we increas e the gravity still more, the light is pulled back \nto the ground near us. Now the cosmic Cheshire cat has vanished; only \nits gravitational grin remains.  \n \n* 1 g is the acceleration experienced by falling objects on the Earth, almost \n10 meters per second every second. A falling rock will reach a speed of 10 \nmeters per second after one second of fall, 20 meters per second after two \nseconds, and so on until it strikes the ground or is slowed by friction with \nthe air. On a world where the gravitational acceleration was much greater, \nfalling bodies would increase their speed by correspondingly greater \namounts. On a world with 10 g acceleration, a rock would travel  10 \u00d7 \n10m/sec or almost 100 m/sec after the first second, 200 m/sec after the \nnext second, and so on. A slight stumble could be fatal. The acceleration \ndue to gravity should always be written with a lowercase g, to distinguish \nit from the Newtonian gravita tional constant, G, which is a measure of \nthe strength of gravity everywhere in the universe, not merely on whatever \nworld or sun we are discussing. (The Newtonian relationship of the two \nquantities is F = mg = GMm/r2; g = GM/r2, where F is the gravitational \nforce, M is the mass of the planet or star, m is the mass of the falling object, \nand r is the distance from the falling object to the center of the planet or \nstar.) \n 419 \nThe Lives of the Stars \u2014  \nWhen the gravity is sufficiently high, nothing, not even light, can \nget out. Such a place is called a black hole. Enigmatically indifferent \nto its surroundings, it is a kind of cosmic Cheshire cat. When the \ndensity and gravity become sufficiently high, the  black hole winks out \nand disappears from our universe. That is why it is called black: no \nlight can escape from it. On the inside, because the light is trapped \ndown there, things may be attractively well - lit. Even if a black hole is \ninvisible from the ou tside, its gravitational presence can be palpable. \nIf, on an interstellar voyage, you are not paying attention, you can find \nyourself drawn into it irrevocably, your body stretched unpleasantly \ninto a long, thin thread. But the matter accreting into a disk  \nsurrounding the black hole would be a sight worth remembering, in \nthe unlikely case that you survived the trip.  \nThermonuclear reactions in the solar interior support the outer \nlayers of the Sun and postpone for billions of years a catastrophic \ngravitational collapse. For white dwarfs, the pressure of the electrons, \nstripped from their nuclei, holds the star up. For neutron stars, the \npressure of the neutrons staves off gravity. But  \nfor an elderly star left after supernova explosions and other \nimpetuosities with more than several times the Sun\u2019s mass, there are \nno forces known that can prevent collapse. The star shrinks \nincredibly, spins, reddens and disappears. A star twenty times th e mass \nof the Sun will shrink until it is the size of Greater Los Angeles; the \ncrushing gravity becomes 1010 g\u2019s, and the star slips through a self -\ngenerated crack in the space -time continuum and vanishes from our \nuniverse.  \nBlack holes were first thought of by the English astronomer John \nMichell in 1783. But the idea seemed so bizarre that it was generally \nignored until quite recently. Then, to the astonishment of many, \nincluding many astronomers, evidence was actually found for the \nexistence of black holes in space. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is opaque \nto X-rays. To determine whether astronomical objects emit such short \nwavelengths of light, an X -ray telescope must be carried aloft. The first \nX-ray observatory was an admirably in ternational effort, orbited by the \nUnited States from an Italian launch platform in the Indian Ocean \noff the coast of Kenya and named Uhuru, the Swahili word for \n\u201cfreedom.\u201d In 1971, Uhuru discovered a remarkably bright X -ray \nsource in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan, flickering on and off \na thousand times a second. The source, called Cygnus X -l, must \ntherefore be very small. Whatever the reason for the flicker, \ninformation on when to turn on and off can cross Cyg X -l no faster \nthan the speed of light,  300,000 km/sec. Thus Cyg X -l can be no larger  420 \nthan [300,000 km/sec] \u00d7 [(1/1000) sec] = 300 kilometers across. \nSomething the size of an asteroid is a brilliant, blinking source of X -\nrays, visible over interstellar distances. What could it possibly be? Cyg \nX-1 is in precisely the same place in the sky a s a hot blue supergiant \nstar, which reveals itself in visible light to have a massive close but \nunseen companion that  421 \u2014 Cosmos  \ngravitationally tugs it first in one direction and then in another. The \ncompanion\u2019s mass is about ten times that of the Sun. The supergiant \nis an unlikely source of X -rays, and it is tempting to identify the \ncompanion inferred in visible light with the sou rce detected in X -ray \nlight. But an invisible object weighing ten times more than the Sun \nand collapsed into a volume the size of an asteroid can only be a black \nhole. The X -rays are plausibly generated by friction in the disk of gas \nand dust accreted arou nd Cyg X -l from its supergiant companion. \nOther stars called V861 Scorpii, GX339 -4, SS433, and Circinus X -2 \nare also candidate black holes. Cassiopeia A is the remnant of a \nsupernova whose light should have reached the Earth in the \nseventeenth century, whe n there were a fair number of astronomers. \nYet no one reported the explosion. Perhaps, as I. S. Shklovskii has \nsuggested, there is a black hole hiding there, which ate the exploding \nstellar core and damped the fires of the supernova. Telescopes in space \nare the means for checking these shards and fragments of data that \nmay be the spoor, the trail, of the legendary black hole.  \nA helpful way to understand black holes is to think about the \ncurvature of space. Consider a flat, flexible, lined two -dimensional \nsurface, like a piece of graph paper made of rubber. If we drop a small \nmass, the surface is deformed or puckered. A marble r olls around the \npucker in an orbit like that of a planet around the Sun. In this \ninterpretation, which we owe to Einstein, gravity is a distortion in the \nfabric of space. In our example, we see two -dimensional space warped \nby mass into a third physical dim ension. Imagine we live in a three -\ndimensional universe, locally distorted by matter into a fourth physical \ndimension that we cannot perceive directly. The greater the local mass, \nthe more intense the local gravity, and the more severe the pucker, \ndistorti on or warp of space. In this analogy, a black hole is a kind of \nbottomless pit. What happens if you fall in? As seen from the outside, \nyou would take an infinite amount of time to fall in, because all your \nclocks \u2014mechanical and biological \u2014would be perceive d as having \nstopped. But from your point of view, all your clocks would be ticking \naway normally. If you could somehow survive the gravitational tides \nand radiation flux, and (a likely assumption) if the black hole were \nrotating, it is just possible that you might emerge in another part of  \nspace -time\u2014somewhere else in space, somewhen else in time. Such \nworm holes in space, a little like those in an apple, have been seriously \nsuggested, although they have by no means been proved to exist. Might \ngravity tunne ls provide a kind of interstellar or intergalac - tic subway, \npermitting us to travel to inaccessible places much more rapidly than \nwe could in the ordinary way? Can black holes serve as time machines, \ncarrying us to the remote past or the distant future? T he fact that such 422 \u2014 Cosmos  \nideas are being discussed even semi -seriously shows how surreal the \nuniverse may be.  \nWe are, in the most profound sense, children of the Cosmos.  \nThink of the Sun\u2019s heat on your upturned face on a cloudless   423 \nThe Lives of the Stars \u2014  \nThe Milky Way Galaxy rising over an \nocean of another world, high above the  \ngalactic plane.

From 150 million kilometers away, we recognize its power. \nWhat would we feel on its seething self -luminous surface, or immersed \nin its heart of nuclear fire? The Sun warms us and feeds us and permits \nus to see. It fecundated the Earth. It is powe rful beyond human \nexperience. Birds greet the sunrise with an audible ecstasy. Even some \none-celled organisms know to swim to the light. Our ancestors \nworshiped the Sun,* and they were far from foolish. And yet the Sun \nis an ordinary, even a mediocre star.  If we must worship a power \ngreater than ourselves,  \ndoes it not make sense to revere the Sun and stars? Hidden within \nevery astronomical investigation, sometimes so deeply buried that the \nresearcher himself is unaware of its presence, lies a kernel of awe.  \nThe Galaxy is an unexplored continent filled with exotic beings of \nstellar dimensions. We have made a preliminary reconnaissance and \nhave encountered some of the inhabitants. A few of them resemble \nbeings we know. Others are bizarre beyond our most unconst rained \nfantasies. But we are at the very beginning of our exploration. Past \nvoyages of discovery suggest that many of the most interesting \ninhabitants of the galactic continent remain as yet unknown and \nunanticipated. Not far outside the Galaxy there are a lmost certainly \nplanets, orbiting stars in the Magellanic Clouds and in the globular \nclusters that surround the Milky  \nWay. Such worlds would offer a breathtaking view of the Galaxy \nrising \u2014an enormous spiral form comprising 400 billion stellar \ninhabitants, with collapsing gas clouds, condensing planetary sys - \ntems, luminous supergiants, stable middle -aged stars, red giants, white \ndwarfs, planetary nebulae, novae, supernovae, neutron stars and black \nholes. It would be clear from such a world, as it is beginning to be \n 424 \nclear from ours, how our matter, our form and much of our character \nis determined by the deep connection  \nbetween life and the Cosmos.  \n* The early Sumerian pictograph for god was an asterisk, the symbol of \nthe stars.

It was not that all the \nmatter and energy were squeezed into a minor corner of the present \nuniverse; rather, the entire universe, matter and energy  and the space \nthey fill, occupied a very small volume.  \nThere was not much room for events to happen in.  \nIn that titanic cosmic explosion, the universe began an expansion \nwhich has never ceased. It is misleading to describe the expansion of \nthe universe as a sort of distending bubble viewed from the outside. \nBy definition, nothing we can ever know about was outside. It is better \nto think of it from the inside, perhaps with grid lines \u2014imagined to \nadhere to the moving fabric of space \u2014expanding uniformly in all \ndirections. As space stretched, the matter and energy in the universe \nexpanded with it and rapidly co oled. The radiation of the cosmic \nfireball, which, then as now, filled the universe, moved through the \nspectrum \u2014from gamma rays to X -rays to ultraviolet light; through the \nrainbow colors of the visible spectrum; into the infrared and radio \nregions. The rem nants of that fireball, the cosmic background \nradiation, emanating from all parts of the sky can be detected by radio \ntelescopes today. In the early universe, space was brilliantly \nilluminated. As time passed, the fabric of space continued to expand, \nthe r adiation cooled and, in ordinary visible light, for the first time \nspace became dark, as it is today.  \nThe early universe was filled with radiation and a plenum of matter, \noriginally hydrogen and helium, formed from elementary particles in \nthe dense primeval fireball. There was very little to see, if there had \nbeen anyone around to do the seeing. Then littl e pockets of gas, small \nnonuniformities, began to grow. Tendrils of vast gossamer gas clouds \nformed, colonies of great lumbering, slowly spinning things, steadily \nbrightening, each a kind of beast eventually to contain a hundred \nbillion shining points. The  largest recognizable structures in the \nuniverse had formed. We see them today. We ourselves inhabit some \nlost corner of one. We call them galaxies.  \n    About a billion years after the Big Bang, the distribution of matter \nin the universe had become a little lumpy, perhaps because the Big \nBang itself had not been perfectly uniform. Matter was more densely \ncompacted in these lumps than elsewhere. Their g ravity drew to them \nsubstantial quantities of nearby gas, growing clouds of hydrogen and \n \nhelium that were destined to become \nclusters of galaxies. A very small initial \nnonuniformity suffices to produce \nsubstantial condensations of matter later \non. \nAs the gravitational collapse continued, \nthe primordial galaxies  431 \nThe Edge of Forever \u2014  \nspun increasingly faster, because of the conservation of angu-  \nlar momentum. Some flattened, squashing themselves along the axis \nof rotation where gravity is not balanced by centrifugal force. These \nbecame the first spiral galaxies, great rotating pin - wheels of matter in \nopen space. Other protogalaxies with weaker gr avity or less initial \nrotation flattened very little and became the first elliptical galaxies. \nThere are similar galaxies, as if stamped from the same mold, all over \nthe Cosmos because these simple laws of nature \u2014gravity and the \nconservation of angular mom entum \u2014are the same all over the \nuniverse. The physics that works for falling bodies and pirouetting ice \nskaters down here in the microcosm of the Earth makes galaxies up \nthere in the macro - \ncosm of the universe.  \nWithin the nascent galaxies, much smaller clouds were also \nexperiencing gravitational collapse; interior temperatures became very \nhigh, thermonuclear reactions were initiated, and the first  \nstars turned on. The hot, massive young stars evolved rapidly, \nprofligates carelessly spending their capital of hydrogen fuel, soon \nending their lives in brilliant supernova explosions, returning \nthermonuclear ash \u2014helium, carbon, oxygen and heavier element s\u2014to \nthe interstellar gas for subsequent generations of star formation. \nSupernova explosions of massive early stars produced successive \noverlapping shock waves in the adjacent gas, compressing the \nintergalactic medium and accelerating the generation of clu sters of \ngalaxies. Gravity is opportunistic, amplifying even small condensations \nof matter. Supernova shock waves may have contributed to accretions \nof matter at every scale. The epic of cosmic evolution had begun, a \nhierarchy in the condensation of matter  from the gas of the Big Bang \u2014\nclusters of galaxies, galaxies, stars, planets, and, eventually, life and an \nintelligence able to understand a little of the elegant process \nresponsible for its origin.  \nClusters of galaxies fill the universe today. Some are insignificant, \npaltry collections of a few dozen galaxies. The affectionately titled \n\u201cLocal Group\u201d contains only two large galaxies of any size, both spirals: \nthe Milky Way and M31. Other clusters run to immense hordes of \nthousands of galaxies in mutual gravitational embrace. There is some \nhint that the Virgo cluster contains tens of thousands of galaxies.  \nOn the largest scale, we inhabit a universe of galaxies, perhaps a \nhundred billion exquisite examples of cosmic architecture and decay, \nwith order and disorder equally evident: normal spirals, turned at \nvarious angles to our earthly line of sight (face -on we see the spiral \narms, edge -on, the central lanes of gas and dust in which the arms are \nformed); barred spirals with a river of gas and dust and stars running \nthrough the center, connecting the spiral arms on opposite sides; stately giant elliptical galax ies containing \nmore than a trillion stars which have \ngrown so large because they have \nswallowed and merged with other \ngalaxies; a plethora of dwarf ellipticals, \nthe galactic midges, each containing \nsome paltry  \nNGC 147, a small elliptical galaxy that \naccompanies M31.

Galactic collisions \ndistort the shape of an originally spherical cluster and may also \ncontribute to the genesis of spirals and irregulars from ellipticals. The \nform and abundance of the galaxies have a sto ry to tell us of ancient \nevents on the largest possible scale, a story we are just beginning to \nread.  \nThe development of high -speed computers make possible \nnumerical experiments on the collective motion of thousands or tens \nof thousands of points, each representing a star, each under the \ngravitational influence of all the other points. In some cases, spira l \narms form all by themselves in a galaxy that has already flattened to a \ndisk. Occasionally a spiral arm may be produced by the close \ngravitational encounter of two galaxies, each of course composed of \nbillions of stars. The gas and dust diffusely spread through such \ngalaxies will collide and become warmed. But when two galaxies \ncollide, the stars pass effortlessly by one another, like bullets through \na swarm of bees, because a galaxy is made mostly of nothing and the \nspaces between the stars are vast. Nev ertheless, the configuration of \nthe galaxies can be distorted severely. A direct impact on one galaxy \nby another can send the constituent stars pouring and careening \nthrough intergalactic space, a galaxy wasted. When a small galaxy runs \ninto a larger one f ace-on it can produce one of the loveliest of the rare \nirregulars, a ring galaxy thousands of light -years across, set against the \nvelvet of intergalactic space. It is a splash in the galactic pond, a \ntemporary configuration of disrupted stars, a galaxy wit h a central \npiece torn out.  \nThe unstructured blobs of irregular galaxies, the arms of spiral \ngalaxies and the torus of ring galaxies exist for only a few frames in the \ncosmic motion picture, then dissipate, often to be reformed again. \nOur sense of galaxies as ponderous rigid bodies i s mistaken. They are \nfluid structures with 100 billion stellar components. Just as a human \nbeing, a collection of 100 trillion cells, is typically in a steady state \n \nbetween synthesis and decay and is more \nthan the sum of its parts, so also is a galaxy.  \nThe suicide rate among galaxies is high. \nSome nearby examples, tens or hundreds \nof millions of light -years away, are powerful \nsources of X -rays, infrared radiation and \nradio waves, have extremely luminous \ncores and fluctuate in brightness on time  434 \nThe Edge of Forever  \u2014  \nscales of weeks.

They seem to \npartake vigorously in the expansion of the \nuniverse, some receding from us at more \nthan 90 percent the speed of light. If they \nare very far, they must be intrinsically \nextremely bright to be visible over such \ndistances;  some are as bright as a \nthousand supernovae exploding at once. \nJust as for Cyg X -1, their rapid \nfluctuations show their enormous \nbrightness to be confined to a very small \nvolume, in this case less than the size of \nthe solar system. Some remarkable process  must be responsible for the vast outpouring of energy in a \nquasar. Among the proposed explanations are: (1) quasars are monster \nversions of pulsars, with a rapidly rotating supermassive core  \nconnected to a strong magnetic field; (2) quasars are due to multiple \ncollisions of millions of stars densely packed into the galactic core, \ntearing away the outer layers and exposing to full view the billion -\ndegree temperatures of the interiors of massive  stars; (3), a related idea, \nquasars are galaxies in which the stars are so densely packed that a \nsupernova explosion in one will rip away the outer layers of another \nand make it a supernova, producing a stellar chain reaction; (4) quasars \nare powered by t he violent mutual annihilation of matter and \nantimatter, somehow preserved in the quasar until now; (5) a quasar \nis the energy released when gas and dust and stars fall into an immense \nblack hole in the core of such a galaxy, perhaps itself the product of \nages of collision and coalescence of smaller black holes; and (6) quasars \nare \u201cwhite holes,\u201d the other side of black holes, a funneling and \neventual emergence into view of matter pouring into a multitude of \nblack holes in other parts of the universe, or ev en in other universes.  \nIn considering the quasars, we confront profound mysteries. \nWhatever the cause of a quasar explosion, one thing seems clear: such \na violent event must produce untold havoc. In every quasar explosion \nmillions of worlds \u2014some with life and the intelligence to  understand \nwhat is happening \u2014may be utterly destroyed. The study of the galaxies \nreveals a universal order and beauty. It also shows us chaotic violence \non a scale hitherto undreamed of. That we live in a universe which \npermits life is remarkable. That we  live in one which destroys galaxies \nand stars and worlds is also remarkable. The universe seems neither \nbenign nor hostile, merely indifferent to the concerns of such puny \ncreatures as we.  \nEven a galaxy so seemingly well -mannered as the Milky Way has its \nstirrings and its dances. Radio observations show two enormous \nclouds of hydrogen gas, enough to make millions of suns, plummeting \nout from the galactic core, as if a mild explosion happened  there every \nnow and then. A high -energy astronomical observatory in Earth orbit \nhas found the galactic core to be a strong source of a particular gamma \nray spectral line, consistent with the idea that a massive black hole is \nhidden there.  \nGalaxies like the Milky Way may represent the staid middle age in a \ncontinuous evolutionary sequence, which encompasses, in their \nviolent adolescence, quasars and exploding galaxies: because  \n437 \nThe Edge of Forever \u2014  \nCentaurus A (NGC 5128), perhaps the \ncollision of a giant elliptical and a spiral \ngalaxy whose shattered arms we see edge - \non. Today, it is more customary to think of \nit as a giant elliptical, with a sparse \ncomplement of gas and dust, completely \nencircled b y a disk of gas and dust and, \nperhaps, some stars. It is an intense source \nof radio waves, which pour out of two great \nlobes oriented at right angles to the disk of \ndust; and X -rays and gamma rays as well. \nRapid fluctuations in the X -ray  \nemission may be due to the engulfing of \nentire clusters of stars by a giant black hole \nhidden at its center. Centaurus A is 14 \nmillion light -years away; its radio lobes are \n3 million light -years long. Courtesy Hale \nObservatories.  \nthe quasars are so distant, we see them in their youth, as they were billions \nof years ago.  \nThe stars of the Milky Way move with systematic grace.  \nGlobular clusters plunge through the galactic plane and out the other \nside, where they slow, reverse and hurtle back again. If we could follow \nthe motion of individual stars bobbing about the galactic plane, they \nwould resemble a froth of popcorn. We have never seen a galaxy \nchange its form significantly only because it takes so long to move. \nThe Milky Way rotates once every quarter billion years. If we were to \nspeed the rotation, we would see that the Galaxy is a dynamic, almost \norganic entity, in some way s resembling a multi -cellular organism. Any \nastronomical photograph of a galaxy is merely a snapshot of one stage \nin its ponderous motion and evolution.* The inner region of a galaxy \nrotates as a solid body. But, beyond that, like the planets around the \nSun following Kepler\u2019s third law, the outer provinces rotate \nprogressively more slowly. The arms have a tendency to wind up \naround the core in an ever -tightening spiral, and gas and dust \naccumulate in spiral patterns of greater density, which are in turn the  \nlocales for the formation of young, hot, bright stars, the stars that \noutline the spiral arms. These stars shine for ten million years or so, a \nperiod corresponding to only 5 percent of a galactic rotation. But as \nthe stars that outline a spiral arm burn out, new stars and their \nassociated nebulae are formed just behind them, and the spiral pattern \npersists. The stars that outline the arms do not survive even a single \ngalactic rotation; only the spiral pattern remains.  \n438 \n \n* This is not quite true. The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of \nlight-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was \ntens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic \ndynamics occupy tens of milli ons of years, so the error in thinking of an \nimage of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.  \n439  \n \u2014 Cosmos  \n \n \nThe Doppler effect. A stationary source of \nsound or light emits a set of spherical \nwaves. If the source is in motion from right \nto left, it emits spherical waves \nprogressively centered on points 1 through \n6, as shown. But an observer at B sees the \nwaves as  stretched out, while an observer at \nA sees them as compressed. A receding \nsource is seen as red -shifted (the wavelengths made longer); an approaching source is seen as blue -shifted \n(the wavelengths made shorter). The Doppler effect is the key to \ncosmology . \nThe speed of any given star around the center of the Galaxy is \ngenerally not the same as that of the spiral pattern. The Sun has been \nin and out of spiral arms often in the twenty times it has gone around \nthe Milky Way at 200 kilometers per second (roughly  half a million \nmiles per hour). On the average, the Sun and the planets spend forty \nmillion years in a spiral arm, eighty million outside, another forty \nmillion in, and so on. Spiral arms outline the region where the latest \ncrop of newly hatched stars is being formed, but not necessarily where \nsuch middle -aged stars as the Sun happen to be. In this epoch, we live \nbetween spiral arms.  \nThe periodic passage of the solar system through spiral arms may \nconceivably have had important consequences for us. About ten \nmillion years ago, the Sun emerged from the Gould  \nBelt complex of the Orion Spiral Arm, which is now a little less than \na thousand light -years away. (Interior to the Orion arm is the \nSagittarius arm; beyond the Orion arm is the Perseus arm.) When the \nSun passes through a spiral arm it is more likely than it is at present to \nenter into gaseous nebulae and interstellar dust clouds and to \nencounter objects of substellar mass. It has been suggested that the \nmajor ice ages on our planet, which recur every hundred million years \nor so, may be due to the interposi tion of interstellar matter between \nthe Sun and the Earth. W. Napier and S. Clube have proposed that a \nnumber of the moons, asteroids, comets and circumplanetary rings in \nthe solar system once freely wandered in interstellar space until they \nwere captured as the Sun plunged through the Orion spiral arm. This \nis an intriguing idea, although perhaps not very likely. But it is testable. \nAll we need do is procure a sample of, say, Phobos or a comet and \nexamine its magnesium isotopes. The relative abundance of \nmagnesium isotopes (all sharing the same number of protons, but \nhaving differing numbers of neutrons) depends on the precise \nsequence of stellar nucleosynthetic events, including the timing of \nnearby supernova explosions, that produced any particular sample  of \nmagnesium. In a different corner of the Galaxy, a different sequence \nof events should have occurred and a different ratio of magnesium \nisotopes should prevail.  \nThe discovery of the Big Bang and the recession of the galaxies came \nfrom a commonplace of nature called the Doppler ef-  \nfect. We are used to it in the physics of sound. An automobile driver \nspeeding by us blows his horn. Inside the car, the driver hears a steady \nblare at a fixed pitch. But outside the car, we hear a characteristic \nchange in pitch. To us, the sound of the ho rn slides from high \n440  \nfrequencies to low. A racing car traveling \nat 200 kilometers per hour (120 miles \nper hour) is going almost one - fifth the \nspeed of sound. Sound is a succession of \nwaves in air, a crest and a trough, a crest \nand a trough. The closer together the \nwaves are, the higher the frequency or \npitch; the farther apart the waves are, the \nlower the pitch. If the car is racing away \nfrom us, it   \nThe Edge of Forever \u2014 253 \nstretches out the sound waves, moving them, from our point of view, \nto a lower pitch and producing the characteristic sound with which \nwe are all familiar. If the car were racing toward us, the sound waves \nwould be squashed together, the frequency would be  increased, and \nwe would hear a high -pitched wail. If we knew what the ordinary pitch \nof the horn was when the car was at rest, we could deduce its speed \nblindfolded, from the change in pitch.  \nLight is also a wave. Unlike sound, it travels perfectly well  \nthrough a vacuum. The Doppler effect works here as well. If instead \nof sound the automobile were for some reason emitting, front and \nback, a beam of pure yellow light, the frequency of the light would \nincrease slightly as the car approached and decrease slightly as the car \nreceded. At ordinary speeds the effect would be im perceptible. If, \nhowever, the car were somehow traveling at a good fraction of the \nspeed of light, we would be able to observe the color of the light \nchanging toward higher frequency, that  is, toward blue, as the car \napproached us; and toward lower frequencies, that is, toward red, as \nthe car receded from us. An object approaching us at very high \nvelocities is perceived to have the color of its spectral lines blue -shifted. \nAn object recedin g from us at very high velocities has its spectral lines \nred-shifted.* This red shift, observed in the spectral lines of distant \ngalaxies and interpreted as a Doppler effect, is the key to cosmology.  \nDuring the early years of this century, the world\u2019s largest telescope, \ndestined to discover the red shift of remote galaxies, was being built \non Mount Wilson, overlooking what were then the clear skies of Los \nAngeles. Large pieces of the telescope had to b e hauled to the top of \nthe mountain, a job for mule teams. A young mule skinner named \nMilton Humason helped to transport mechanical and optical \nequipment, scientists, engineers and dignitaries up the mountain. \nHumason would lead the column of mules on hors eback, his white \nterrier standing just behind the saddle, its front paws on Humason\u2019s \nshoulders. He was a tobacco -chewing roustabout, a superb gambler \nand pool player and what was then called a ladies\u2019 man. In his formal \neducation, he had never gone beyond  the eighth grade. But he was \nbright and curious and naturally inquisitive about the equipment he \nhad laboriously carted to the heights. Humason was keeping company \nwith the daughter of one of the observatory engineers, a man who \nharbored reservations abou t his daughter seeing a young man who had \nno higher ambition than to be a mule skinner. So Humason took odd \njobs at the observatory \u2014electrician\u2019s assistant, janitor, swabbing the \nfloors of the telescope he  \n * The object itself might be any color, even \nblue. The red shift means only that each \nspectral line appears at longer wavelengths \nthan when the object is at rest; the \namount of the red shift is proportional \nboth to the velocity and to the wavelength \nof the  spectral line when the object is at \nrest. \nColliding galaxies about 50 million light - \nyears away.

One evening, so the story goes, the night \ntelescope assistant fell ill and Humason was asked if he might fill in. \nHe displayed such skill and care with the instruments that he soon \nbecame a permanent telescope operator and observing ai de. \nAfter World War I, there came to Mount Wilson the soon - to-be \nfamous Edwin Hubble \u2014brilliant, polished, gregarious outside the \nastronomical community, with an English accent acquired during a \nsingle year as Rhodes scholar at Oxford. It was Hubble who provid ed \nthe final demonstration that the spiral nebulae were in fact \u201cisland \nuniverses,\u201d distant aggregations of enormous numbers of stars, like our \nown Milky Way Galaxy; he had figured out the stellar standard candle \nrequired to measure the distances to the ga laxies. Hubble and \nHumason hit it off splendidly, a perhaps unlikely pair who worked \ntogether at the telescope harmoniously. Following a lead by the \nastronomer V. M. Slipher at Lowell Observatory, they began \nmeasuring the spectra of distant galaxies. It so on became clear that \nHumason was better able to obtain high -quality spectra of distant \ngalaxies than any professional astronomer in the world. He became a \nfull staff member of the Mount Wilson Observatory, learned many of \nthe scientific underpinnings of hi s work and died rich in the respect \nof the astronomical community.  \nThe light from a galaxy is the sum of the light emitted by the billions \nof stars within it. As the light leaves these stars, certain frequencies or \ncolors are absorbed by the atoms in the stars\u2019 outermost layers. The \nresulting lines permit us to tell that stars millions of light -years away \ncontain the same chemical elements as our Sun and the nearby stars. \nHumason and Hubble found, to their amazement, that the spectra of \nall the distant galaxies are red -shifted and, still more startling, that the \nmore dista nt the galaxy was, the more red -shifted were its spectral lines.  \nThe most obvious explanation of the red shift was in terms of the \nDoppler effect: the galaxies were receding from us; the more distant \nthe galaxy the greater its speed of recession. But why should the \ngalaxies be fleeing us? Could there be something specia l about our \nlocation in the universe, as if the Milky Way had performed some \ninadvertent but offensive act in the social life of galaxies? It seemed \nmuch more likely that the universe itself was expanding, carrying the \ngalaxies with it. Humason and Hubble,  it gradually became clear, had \ndiscovered the Big  \nBang \u2014if not the origin of the universe then at least its most recent \nincarnation.  \nAlmost all of modern cosmology \u2014and especially the idea of an \nexpanding universe and a Big Bang \u2014is based on the idea that the red \n444  \nshift of distant galaxies is a Doppler effect \nand arises from their speed of recession. \nBut there are other kinds of red shifts in \nnature. There is, for example, the \ngravitational red shift, in which the light \nleaving an intense gravitational field has \nto do so much work to escape that it loses \nenergy during the journey, the   \nThe Edge of Forever  \u2014 \n255 \n \nprocess perceived by a distant observer as a shift of the escaping light \nto longer wavelengths and redder colors. Since we think there may be \nmassive black holes at the centers of some galaxies, this is a conceivable \nexplanation of their red shifts. Howeve r, the particular spectral lines \nobserved are often characteristic of very thin, diffuse gas, and not the \nastonishingly high density that must prevail near black holes. Or the \nred shift might be a Doppler effect due not to the general expansion \nof the univ erse but rather to a more modest and local galactic \nexplosion. But then we should expect as many explosion fragments \ntraveling toward us as away from us, as many blue shifts as red shifts. \nWhat we actually see, however, is almost exclusively red shifts no \nmatter what distant objects beyond the Local Group we point our \ntelescopes to.  \nThere is nevertheless a nagging suspicion among some astronomers \nthat all may not be right with the deduction, from the red shifts of \ngalaxies via the Doppler effect, that the universe is expanding. The \nastronomer Halton Arp has found enigmatic and disturb ing cases \nwhere a galaxy and a quasar, or a pair of galaxies, that are in apparent \nphysical association have very different red shifts. Occasionally there \nseems to be a bridge of gas and dust and stars connecting them. If the \nred shift is due to the expans ion of the universe, very different red \nshifts imply very different distances. But two galaxies that are physically connected can hardly also be \ngreatly separated from each other \u2014in \nsome cases by a billion light -years. \nSkeptics say that the association is purely \nstatistical: that, for example, a nearby \nbright galaxy and a much  \nA portion of the Hercules cluster of \ngalaxies, with about 300 known members, \nretreating from our region of the Cosmos at \nsome 10,000 kilometers per second. In this \nphotograph there are more galaxies (in \nexcess of 300 million light -years distant) \nthan there  are foreground stars in our Milky \nWay Galaxy. If the Hercules Cluster is not \nflying apart, there must be five times more \nmass there, gravitationally gluing the cluster \ntogether, than we see in its galaxies. Such \n\u201cmissing mass,\u201d if common in intergalactic \nspace, would make a major contribution to \nclosing the universe.

Courtesy Hale Observatories.  more distant quasar, each having very different red shifts and very \ndifferent speeds of recession, are merely accidentally aligned along the \nline of sight; that they have no real physical association. Such statistical \nalignments must happen by chance every  now and then. The debate \ncenters on whether the number of coincidences is more than would \nbe expected by chance. Arp points to other cases in which a galaxy with \na small red shift is flanked by two quasars of large and almost identical \nred shift. He belie ves the quasars are not at cosmological distances but \ninstead are being ejected, left and right, by the \u201cforeground\u201d galaxy; \nand that the red shifts are the result of some as -yet-unfathomed \nmechanism. Skeptics argue coincidental alignment and the \nconventio nal Hubble -Humason interpretation of the red shift. If Arp \nis right, the exotic mechanisms proposed to explain the energy source \nof distant quasars \u2014supernova chain reactions, supermassive black \nholes and the like \u2014would prove unnecessary. Quasars need not t hen \nbe very distant. But some other exotic mechanism will be required to \nexplain the red shift. In either case, something very strange is going on \nin the depths of space.  \nThe apparent recession of the galaxies, with the red shift interpreted \nthrough the Doppler effect, is not the only evidence for the Big Bang. \nIndependent and quite persuasive evidence derives from the cosmic \nblack body background radiation, the faint stati c of radio waves \ncoming quite uniformly from all directions in the Cosmos at just the \nintensity expected in our epoch from the now substantially cooled \nradiation of the Big Bang. But here also there is something puzzling. \nObservations with a sensitive radi o antenna carried near the top of the \nEarth\u2019s atmosphere in a U -2 aircraft have shown that the background \nradiation is, to first approximation, just as intense in all directions \u2014as \nif the fireball of the Big Bang expanded quite uniformly, an origin of \nthe universe with a very precise symmetry. But the background \nradiation, when examined to finer precision, proves to be imperfectly \nsymmetrical. There is a small systematic effect that could be \nunderstood if the entire Milky Way Galaxy (and presumably other \nmembers of the Local Group) were streaking toward the Virgo cluster \nof galaxies at more than a million miles an hour (600 kilometers per \nsecond). At such a rate, we will reach it in ten billion years, and \nextragalactic astronomy will then be a great deal eas ier. The Virgo \ncluster is already the richest collection of galaxies known, replete with \nspirals and ellipticals and irregulars, a jewel box in the sky. But why \nshould we be rushing toward it? George Smoot and his colleagues, who \nmade these high -altitude o bservations, suggest that the Milky Way is \nbeing gravitationally dragged toward the center of the Virgo cluster; \nthat the cluster has many more galaxies than have been detected \nheretofore; and, most startling, that the cluster is of immense \nproportions, st retching across one or two billion light -years of space.  \n447  \nThe observable universe itself is only a \nfew tens of billions of   \nThe Edge of Forever \u2014 257 \nlight-years across and, if there is a vast supercluster in the Virgo  \ngroup, perhaps there are other such superclusters at much greater \ndistances, which are correspondingly more difficult to detect. In the \nlifetime of the universe there has apparently not been enough time for \nan initial gravitational nonuniformity to collect  the amount of mass \nthat seems to reside in the Virgo supercluster. Thus Smoot is tempted \nto conclude that the Big Bang was much less uniform than his other \nobservations suggest, that the original distribution of matter in the \nuniverse was very lumpy. (Som e little lumpiness is to be expected, and \nindeed even needed to understand the condensation of galaxies; but a \nlumpiness on this scale is a surprise.) Perhaps the paradox can be \nresolved by imagining two or more nearly simultaneous Big Bangs.  \nIf the general picture of an expanding universe and a Big Bang is \ncorrect, we must then confront still more difficult questions. What \nwere conditions like at the time of the Big Bang? What happened \nbefore that? Was there a tiny universe, devoid of all matt er, and then \nthe matter suddenly created from nothing? How does that happen? In \nmany cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe \nout of nothing. But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously \nto pursue the question, we must, of course ask next where God comes \nfrom. And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step \nand decide that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable \nquestion? Or, if we say that God has always existed, why not save a step \nand conclude that the  universe has always existed?  \nEvery culture has a myth of the world before creation, and of the \ncreation of the world, often by the mating of the gods or the hatching \nof a cosmic egg. Commonly, the universe is na\u00efvely imagined to follow \nhuman or animal precedent. Here, for example, are  five small extracts \nfrom such myths, at different levels of sophistication, from the Pacific \nBasin:  \nIn the very beginning everything was resting in perpetual \ndarkness: night oppressed everything like an impenetrable \nthicket.  \n\u2014The Great Father myth of \nthe Aranda people of \nCentral Australia  \nAll was in suspense, all calm, all in silence; all motionless and still; \nand the expanse of the sky was empty.  \n\u2014The Popol Vuh of the Quiche \nMaya  \nNa Arean sat alone in space as a cloud that floats in \nnothingness. He slept not, for there was no sleep; he hungered not, for as yet there was no hunger. \nSo he remained for a great while, \nuntil a thought came to his mind. \nHe said to  \nhimself, \u201cI will make a thing.\u201d  \n\u2014A \nmyth \nfrom \nMaia\nna, \nGilbert Islands  \nAn ancient Chinese creation image \nshowing the intertwined double helix, \nrepresenting an interaction of opposites, \nresulting in the Creation.

God (top) makes \nthe Earth and its inhabitants (the first \nhumans, Adam and Eve, at center). \nSurrounding the Earth are birds, clouds, the Sun, the Moon and the stars, above which are \u201cthe waters of the \nfirmament.\u201d From Martin Luther\u2019s Biblia,  published by  \nHans Lufft, Wittenberg, 1534 - \nFirst there was the great cosmic egg. Inside the egg was chaos, \nand floating in chaos was Pan Ku, the Undeveloped, the divine \nEmbryo. And P\u2019an Ku burst out of the egg, four times larger than \nany man today, with a hammer and chisel in his hand with which \nhe fashioned the world.  \n\u2014The P\u2019an Ku myths, China  \n(around third century)  \nBefore heaven and earth had taken form all was vague and \namorphous . . . That which was clear and light drifted up to \nbecome heaven, while that which was heavy and turbid solidified \nto become earth. It was very easy for the pure, fine material to \ncome toge ther, but extremely difficult for the heavy, turbid \nmaterial to solidify. Therefore heaven was completed first and \nearth assumed shape after. When heaven and earth were joined \nin emptiness and all was unwrought simplicity, then without \nhaving been created things came into being. This was the Great \nOneness. All things issued from this Oneness but all became \ndifferent. . .  \n\u2014Huai -nan Tzu, China  \n(around first century B.C.) \nThese myths are tributes to human audacity. The chief difference \nbetween them and our modern scientific myth of the Big Bang is that \nscience is self -questioning, and that we can perform experiments and \nobservations to test our ideas. But those other  \ncreation stories are worthy of our deep respect.  \nEvery human culture rejoices in the fact that there are cycles in \nnature. But how, it was thought, could such cycles come about unless \nthe gods willed them? And if there are cycles in the years of humans, \nmight there not be cycles in the aeons of the gods?  The Hindu religion \nis the only one of the world\u2019s great faiths dedicated to the idea that \nthe Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number \nof deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which the time scales \ncorrespond, no doubt by a ccident, to those of modern scientific \ncosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and \nnight of Brahma,  \n8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun \nand about half the time since the Big Bang. And there are much longer \ntime scales still.  \nThere is the deep and appealing notion that the universe is but the \ndream of the god who, after a hundred Brahma years, dissolves himself \ninto a dreamless sleep. The universe dissolves with him \u2014until, after \n451 \u2014 Cosmos  \nanother Brahma century, he stirs, \nrecomposes himself and begins again to \ndream the great cosmic dream. \nMeanwhile, elsewhere, there are an \ninfinite number of other universes, each \nwith its own god dreaming the cosmic \ndream. These great ideas are tempered by  \nanother, perhaps still greater. It is said \nthat men may not be the dreams of the \ngods, but rather that the gods are the \ndreams of men.  \nIn India there are many gods, and each \ngod has many   \nThe Edge of Forever  \u2014 259 \nmanifestations. The Chola bronzes, cast in the eleventh century, include several different incarnations of the \ngod Shiva. The most  \nelegant and sublime of these is a representation of the creation of the \nuniverse at the beginning of each cosmic cycle, a motif known as the \ncosmic dance of Shiva. The god, called in this manifestation Nataraja, \nthe Dance King, has four hands. In the upper  right hand is a drum \nwhose sound is the sound of creation. In the upper left hand is a \ntongue of flame, a reminder that the universe, now newly created, \nwill billions of years from now be  \nutterly destroyed.  \nThese profound and lovely images are, I like to imagine, a kind of \npremonition of modern astronomical ideas.* Very likely, the universe \nhas been expanding since the Big Bang, but it is by no means clear \nthat it will continue to expand forever. The  \nexpansion may gradually slow, stop and reverse itself. If there is less \nthan a certain critical amount of matter in the universe, the gravitation \nof the receding galaxies will be insufficient to stop the expansion, and \nthe universe will run away forever. B ut if there is more matter than we \ncan see \u2014hidden away in black holes, say, or in hot but invisible gas \nbetween the galaxies \u2014then the universe will hold together \ngravitationally and partake of a very Indian succession of cycles, \nexpansion followed by contr action, universe upon universe, Cosmos \nwithout end. If we live in such an oscillating universe, then the Big \nBang is not the creation of the Cosmos but merely the end of the \nprevious cycle, the destruction of the last incarnation of the Cosmos.  \nNeither of these modern cosmologies may be altogether to our \nliking. In one, the universe is created, somehow, ten or twenty billion \nyears ago and expands forever, the galaxies mutually receding until the \nlast one disappears over our cosmic horizon. Then t he galactic \nastronomers are out of business, the stars cool and die, matter itself \ndecays and the universe becomes a thin cold haze of elementary \nparticles. In the other, the oscillating universe, the Cosmos has no \nbeginning and no end, and we are in the m idst of an infinite cycle of \ncosmic deaths and rebirths with no information trickling through the \ncusps of the oscillation. Nothing of the galaxies, stars, planets, life \nforms or civilizations evolved in the previous incarnation of the \nuniverse oozes into the cusp, flutters past the Big Bang, to be known \nin our present universe. The fate of the universe in either cosmology \nmay seem a little depressing, but we may take solace in the time scales  \n \n*The dates on Mayan inscriptions also range deep into the past and \noccasionally far into the future. One inscription refers to a time more than a \nmillion years ago and another perhaps refers to events of 400 million years ago, although this is in some dispute among \nMayan scholars. The events memorialized \nmay be mythical, but the time scales are \nprodigious. A millennium before Europeans \nwere willing to divest themselves of the \nBiblical idea that the world was a few \nthousand years old, the Mayans were thinkin g \nof millions, and the Indians of billions.  \nNavajo sand painting, \u201cFather Sky and \nMother Earth.\u201d Within the black image of \nFather Sky at left are the various \nconstellations, including, middle, the Big \nDipper.

Human beings \nand our descendants, whoever they \nmight be, can accomplish a great deal in \ntens of billions of years, before the \nCosmos dies.  \nIf the universe truly oscillates, still \nstranger questions arise. Some scientists \nthink that when expansion is followed by \ncontraction, when the spectra of distant \ngalaxies are all blue -shifted, causality will be inverted and effects will precede causes. First the ripples spread \nfrom a point on the water\u2019s surface, then I throw a stone into the \npond. First the torch bursts into flame and then I light it. We cannot \npretend to understand what such causality invers ion means. Will \npeople at such a time be born in the grave and die in the womb? Will \ntime flow backwards? Do these questions have any meaning?  \nScientists wonder about what happens in an oscillating universe at \nthe cusps, at the transition from contraction to expan-  \nsion. Some think that the laws of nature are then randomly reshuffled, \nthat the kind of physics and chemistry that orders this universe \nrepresent only one of an infinite range of possible natural laws. It is \neasy to see that only a very restricted range of  laws of nature are \nconsistent with galaxies and stars, planets, life and intelligence. If the \nlaws of nature are unpredictably reassorted at the cusps, then it is only \nby the most extraordinary coincidence that the cosmic slot machine \nhas this time come u p with a universe consistent with us.*  \nDo we live in a universe that expands forever or in one in which \nthere is an infinite set of cycles? There are ways to find out: by making \nan accurate census of the total amount of matter in the universe, or \nby seeing to the edge of the Cosmos.  \nRadio telescopes can detect very faint, very distant objects. As we \nlook deep into space we also look far back into time. The nearest \nquasar is perhaps half a billion light -years away. The farthest may be \nten or twelve or more billions. But if we see an ob ject twelve billion \nlight-years away, we are seeing it as it was twelve billion years ago in \ntime. By looking far out into space we  \n* The laws of nature cannot be randomly  reshuffled at the cusps. If the universe \nhas already gone through many oscillations, many possible laws of gravity \nwould have been so weak that, for any given initial expansion, the universe \nwould not have held together. Once the universe stumbles upon su ch a \ngravitational law, it flies apart and has no further opportu-  \nnity to experience another oscillation and another cusp and another set of \nlaws of nature. Thus we can deduce from the fact that the universe exists \neither a finite age, or a severe restriction on the kinds of laws of nature \npermitted in each oscillation. If the laws of physics are not randomly \nreshuffled at the cusps, there must be a regularity, a set of rules, that \ndetermines which laws are permissible and which are not. Such a set of rules \nwould comprise a new physics standing over the existing physics. Our \nlanguage is impoverished; there seems to be no suitable name for such a new \nphysics. Both \u201cparaphysics\u201d and \u201cmetaphysics\u201d have been preempted by other \nrather different and, quite possibly, wholly irrelevant activities. Perhaps \n\u201ctransphysics\u201d would do.  \nThe Edge of Forever \u2014 261 \n \nA few of the radio telescopes of the Very \nLarge Array, Socorro, New Mexico, \noperated by the National Radio \nAstronomy Observatory. The telescopes \nmove on railway tracks; their separation \ndetermines the resolution of the resulting \nradio image.  \nare also looking far back into time, back toward the horizon of the \nuniverse, back toward the epoch of the Big Bang.  \nThe Very Large Array (VLA) is a collection of twenty -seven separate \nradio telescopes in a remote region of New Mexico. It is a phased array, \nthe individual telescopes electronically con-  \nnected, as if it were a single telescope of the same size as its remotest \nelements, as if it were a radio telescope tens of kilometers across. The \nVLA is able to resolve or discriminate fine detail in the radio regions \nof the spectrum comparable to what th e largest ground -based \ntelescopes can do in the optical region of the spectrum.  \nSometimes such radio telescopes are connected with telescopes on \nthe other side of the Earth, forming a baseline comparable to the \nEarth\u2019s diameter \u2014in a certain sense, a telescope as large as the planet. \nIn the future we may have telescopes in the Earth\u2019s orbit, around \ntoward the other side of the Sun, in effect a radio tele-  \nscope as large as the inner solar system. Such telescopes may reveal the \ninternal structure and nature of quasars. Perhaps a quasar standard \ncandle will be found, and the distances to the quasars determined \nindependent of their red shifts. By understanding  the structure and \nthe red shift of the most distant quasars it may be possible to see \nwhether the expansion of the universe was faster billions of years ago, \nwhether the expansion is  \nslowing down, whether the universe will one day collapse.  \nModern radio telescopes are exquisitely sensitive; a distant quasar \nis so faint that its detected radiation amounts perhaps to a \nquadrillionth of a watt. The total amount of energy from outside the \nsolar system ever received by all the radio telescopes on the planet \n456 \u2014 Cosmos  \nEarth is less than the energy of a single snowflake striking the ground. \nIn detecting the cosmic background radiation, in  \ncounting quasars, in searching for intelligent signals from space, radio \nastronomers are dealing with amounts of energy that are barely there \nat all.  \nSome matter, particularly the matter in the stars, glows in  \n \nConventional two -dimensional \nrepresentation of a cube.  \n \nConventional  three -dimensional \n representation of a tesseract or \nhypercube (the three -dimensional model \nreduced one further dimension on this \npage).   \nRadio image of elliptical galaxy NGC  \n3266.

It does not \ngive off visible light, although it seems to give off radio waves. This is \none reason that the unlocking of the cosmological mysteries requires \nus to use exotic instruments and frequencies different from the visible \nlight to which our eyes are sensitive. Observatories in Earth orbit have \nfound an intense X -ray glow between the galaxies. It was first thought \nto be ho t intergalactic hydrogen, an immense amount of it never \nbefore seen, perhaps enough to close the Cosmos and to guarantee \nthat we are trapped in an oscillating universe. But more recent \nobservations by Ricardo Giacconi may have resolved the X -ray glow \ninto individual points, perhaps an immense horde of distant quasars. \nThey contribute previously unknown mass to the universe as well. \nWhen the cosmic inventory is completed, and the mass of all the \ngalaxies, quasars, black holes, intergalactic hydrogen, gravita tional \nwaves and still more exotic denizens of space is summed up, we will \nknow what kind of universe we inhabit.  \nIn discussing the large -scale structure of the Cosmos, astronomers \nare fond of saying that space is curved, or that there is no center to the \nCosmos, or that the universe is finite but unbounded. Whatever are \nthey talking about? Let us imagine we inhabit a  strange country where \neveryone is perfectly flat. Following Edwin Abbott, a Shakespearean \nscholar who lived in Victorian England, we call it Flatland. Some of \nus are squares; some are triangles; some have more complex shapes. \nWe scurry about, in and out o f our flat buildings, occupied with our \nflat businesses and dalliances. Everyone in Flatland has width and \nlength, but no height whatever. We know about left -right and forward -\n \nback, but have no hint, not a trace of \ncomprehension, about up -down \u2014except \nfor flat mathematicians. They say, \n\u201cListen, it\u2019s really very easy. Imagine left -\nright. Imagine forward -  \nback. Okay, so far? Now imagine another \ndimension, at right angles to the other \ntwo.\u201d And we say, \u201cWhat are you talking \nabout? \u2018At right angles to the other two\u2019! \nThere are only two dimensions. Point to \nthat third dimension. Where is it?\u201d So \nthe mathematicians, disheartened, amble \noff. Nobody listens to mathematicians.  \nEvery square creature in Flatland sees \nanother square as merely a short line \nsegment, the side of the square nearest to \nhim. He can see the other side of the \nsquare only by taking a short walk. But \nthe inside  of a square is forever \nmysterious, unless some terrible accident \nor autopsy breaches the sides and exposes \nthe interior parts.  \nOne day a three -dimensional \ncreature \u2014shaped like an apple, say \u2014\ncomes upon Flatland, hovering above it. \nObserving a particularly attractive and \ncongenial -looking square entering its flat \nhouse, the apple decides, in a gesture of \ninterdimensional amity, to s ay hello. \n\u201cHow are you?\u201d asks the visitor from the \nthird   \nThe Edge of Forever \u2014 263 \ndimension. \u201cI am a visitor from the third dimension.\u201d The wretched \nsquare looks about his closed house and sees no one. What is worse, \nto him it appears that the greeting, entering from above, is emanating \nfrom his own flat body, a voice from within. A lit tle insanity, he \nperhaps reminds himself gamely, runs in the family.  \nExasperated at being judged a psychological aberration, the apple descends into Flatland. Now a three -\ndimensional creature can exist, in Flatland, only partially; only a cross section can be seen, only the points \nof contact with the plane surface of Flatla nd. An apple slithering through Flatland would appear first as a \npoint and then as progressively larger, roughly circular slices. The square sees a point appearing in a closed \nroom in his two -dimensional world and slowly growing into a near circle. A crea ture of strange and changing \nshape has appeared from nowhere.  \nRebuffed, unhappy at the obtuseness of the very flat, the apple \nbumps the square and sends him aloft, fluttering and spinning into \nthat mysterious third dimension. At first the square can make no \nsense of what is happening; it is utterly outside his experi ence. But \neventually he realizes that he is viewing Flatland from a peculiar \nvantage point: \u201cabove.\u201d He can see into closed rooms. He can see into \nhis flat fellows. He is viewing his universe from a unique and \ndevastating perspective. Traveling through ano ther dimension \nprovides, as an incidental benefit, a kind of X -ray vision. Eventually, \nlike a falling leaf, our square slowly descends to the surface. From the \npoint of view of his fellow Flatlanders, he has unaccountably \ndisappeared from a closed room and  then distressingly materialized \nfrom nowhere. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d they say, \u201cwhat\u2019s happened to \nyou?\u201d \u201cI think,\u201d he finds himself replying, \u201cI was \u2018up.\u2019 \u201d They pat him \non his sides and  \ncomfort him. Delusions always ran in his family.  \nIn such interdimensional contemplations, we need not be \nrestricted to two dimensions. We can, following Abbott, imagine a \nworld of one dimension, where everyone is a line segment, or even \nthe magical world of zero -dimensional beasts, the points.  \nBut perhaps more interesting is the question of higher dimensions. \nCould there be a fourth physical dimension?*  \nWe can imagine generating a cube in the following way: Take a \nline segment of a certain length and move it an equal length at right \nangles to itself. That makes a square. Move the square an equal length \nat right angles to itself, and we have a cube. We  \n \n* If a fourth -dimensional creature existed it could, in our three -\ndimensional universe, appear and dematerialize at will, change shape \nremarkably, pluck us out of locked rooms and make us appear from \nnowhere. It could also turn us inside out. There are sev eral ways in which \nwe can be turned inside out: the least pleasant would result in our viscera \nand internal organs being on the outside and the entire Cosmos \u2014glowing intergalactic gas, galaxies, planets, \neverything \u2014on the inside.

If we examine the shadow of a \ncube in two dimensions, we notice that not all the lines appear equal, \nand not all the angles are right angles. The thr ee-dimensional object \nhas not been perfectly represented in its transfiguration into two \ndimensions. This is the cost of losing a dimension in the geometrical \nprojection. Now let us take our three -dimensional cube and carry it, \nat right angles to itself, t hrough a fourth physical dimension: not left -\nright, not forward - back, not up -down, but simultaneously at right \nangles to all those directions. I cannot show you what direction that \nis, but I can imagine it to exist. In such a case, we would have generated  \na four -dimensional hypercube, also called a tesseract. I cannot show \nyou a tesseract, because we are trapped in three dimensions. But what \nI can show you is the shadow in three dimensions of a tesseract. It \nresembles two nested cubes, all the vertices con nected by lines. But for \na real tesseract, in four dimensions, all the lines would be of equal \nlength and all the angles would be right angles.  \nImagine a universe just like Flatland, except that unbeknownst to \nthe inhabitants, their two -dimensional universe is curved through a \nthird physical dimension. When the Flatlanders take  \nshort excursions, their universe looks flat enough. But if one of them \ntakes a long enough walk along what seems to be a perfectly straight \nline, he uncovers a great mystery: although he has not reached a \nbarrier and has never turned around, he has somehow  come back to \nthe place from which he started. His two - dimensional universe must \nhave been warped, bent or curved through a mysterious third \ndimension. He cannot imagine that third dimension, but he can \ndeduce it. Increase all dimensions in  \nthis story by one, and you have a situation that may apply to us.  \nWhere is the center of the Cosmos? Is there an edge to the universe? \nWhat lies beyond that? In a two -dimensional universe,  \ncurved through a third dimension, there is no center \u2014at least not on \nthe surface of the sphere. The center of such a universe is not in that \nuniverse; it lies, inaccessible, in the third dimension, inside  the sphere. \nWhile there is only so much area on the surface of the sphere, there \nis no edge to this universe \u2014it is finite but unbounded. And the \nquestion of what lies beyond is meaningless. Flat creatures cannot, on \ntheir own, escape their two dimensions.  \nIncrease all dimensions by one, and you have the situation that may \napply to us: the universe as a four -dimensional hypersphere with no \ncenter and no edge, and nothing beyond. Why do all the galaxies seem \nto be running away from us? The hypersphere is expa nding from a \npoint, like a four -dimensional balloon being  \ninflated, creating in every instant more space in the universe. \nSometime after the expansion begins, galaxies condense and are \ncarried outward on the surface of the hypersphere. There are  \nThe Edge of Forever  \u2014 265  \u2014 Cosmos  \nastronomers in each galaxy, and the light they see is also trapped on \nthe curved surface of the hypersphere. As the sphere expands, an \nastronomer in any galaxy will think all the other galaxies are running \naway from him. There are no privileged reference f rames.* The farther \naway the galaxy, the faster its recession. The galaxies are embedded in, \nattached to space, and the fabric of space is expanding. And to the \nquestion, Where in the present universe did the Big Bang occur? the \nanswer is clearly, everywhe re. \nIf there is insufficient matter to prevent the universe from \nexpanding forever, it must have an open shape, curved like a saddle \nwith a surface extending to infinity in our three -dimensional analogy. \nIf there is enough matter, then it has a closed  \nshape, curved like a sphere in our three -dimensional analogy. If the \nuniverse is closed, light is trapped within it. In the 1920\u2019s, in a \ndirection opposite to M31, observers found a distant pair of spiral \ngalaxies. Was it possible, they wondered, that they  were seeing the \nMilky Way and M31 from the other direction \u2014like seeing the back of \nyour head with light that has circumnavigated the universe? We now \nknow that the universe is much larger than they imagined in the \n1920\u2019s. It would take more than the age o f the universe for light to \ncircumnavigate it. And the galaxies are younger than the universe. But \nif the Cosmos is closed and light  \ncannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to describe the \nuniverse as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a \nblack hole, look around you.  \nWe have previously mentioned the possibility of wormholes to get \nfrom one place in the universe to another without covering the \nintervening distance \u2014through a black hole. We can imagine these \nwormholes as tubes running through a fourth physical dimension. We \ndo not know that such wormholes exist. But if they do, must they \nalways hook up with another place in our universe? Or is it just \npossible that wormholes connect with other universes, places that \nwould otherwise be forever inaccessible to us? For all we  know, there \nmay be many other universes. Perhaps  \nthey are, in some sense, nested within one another.  \nThere is an idea \u2014strange, haunting, evocative \u2014one of the most \nexquisite conjectures in science or religion. It is entirely \nundemonstrated; it may never be proved. But it stirs the blood. There \nis, we are told, an infinite hierarchy of universes, so that an  elementary \nparticle, such as an electron, in our universe would, if penetrated, \nreveal itself to be an entire closed universe. Within it, organized into \nthe local equivalent of galaxies and smaller structures, are an immense \nnumber of other, much tinier e lementary particles, which are \nthemselves universe at the next  \n \n* The view that the universe looks by and large the same no matter from \nwhere we happen to view it was first proposed, so far as we know, by \nGiordano Bruno.  \n266 \n \n \n \nThe Edge of Forever \u2014 261 \nlevel, and so on forever \u2014an infinite downward regression, universes \nwithin universes, endlessly. And upward as well. Our familiar universe \nof galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary \nparticle in the next universe up, the first s tep of another infinite \nregress.  \nThis is the only religious idea I know that surpasses the endless \nnumber of infinitely old cycling universes in Hindu cosmology. What \nwould those other universes be like? Would they be built on different \nlaws of physics? Would they have stars and galaxies and worlds, or \nsomething quite different? Might they be compatible with some \nunimaginably different form of life? To enter them, we would \nsomehow have to penetrate a fourth physical dimension \u2014not an easy \nundertaking, surely, but perhaps a black hole would provide a way. \nThere may be small black holes in the solar neighborhood. Poised at \nthe edge of forever, we would jump off. . .   \nInfinite regression.

A nd, that no region might be without its own forms of animate life, the \nstars and divine forms occupied the floor of heaven, the sea fell to the shining \nfishes for their home, Earth received the beasts, and the mobile air the birds . . . \nThen Man was born: . . . though all other animals are prone, and fix their gaze \nupon the earth, he gave to Man an uplifted face and bade him stand erect and \nturn his eyes to heaven.  \n\u2014Ovid, Metamorphoses , first century  \nIN THE GREAT COSMIC DARK THERE ARE  countless stars and \nplanets both younger and older than our solar system. Although we \ncannot yet be certain, the same processes that led on Earth to the \nevolution of life and intelligence should have been operating \nthroughout the Cosmos. There may be a mi llion worlds in the Milky \nWay Galaxy alone that at this moment are inhabited by beings who \nare very different from us, and far more advanced. Knowing a great \ndeal is not the same as being smart; intelligence is not information \nalone but also judgment, the manner in which information is \ncoordinated and used. Still, the amount of information to which we \nhave access is one index of our intelligence. The measuring rod, the \nunit of information, is something called a bit (for binary digit). It is an  \nanswer \u2014either yes or no \u2014to an unambiguous question. To specify \nwhether a lamp is on or off requires a single bit of information. To \ndesignate one letter out of the twenty -six in the Latin alphabet takes \nfive bits (25 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 32, which is mor e than 26). The \nverbal information content of this book is a little less than ten million \nbits, 107. The total number of bits that characterizes an hour -long \n466 \u2014 Cosmos  \ntelevision program is about 1012. The information in the words and \npictures of different books in all the libraries on the Earth is \nsomething like 1016 or 1017 bits.* Of course much of it is redundant. \nSuch a number calibrates crudely what humans know. But elsewhere, \non older worlds, where life has evolved billions of years earlier than \non Earth, perhaps they know 1020 bits or 1030\u2014 not just more \ninformation but significantly different information.  \nOf those million worlds inhabited by advanced intelligences, \nconsider a rare planet, the only one in its system with a surface ocean \nof liquid water. In this rich aquatic environment, many relatively \nintelligent creatures live \u2014some with eight appendages fo r grasping; \nothers that communicate among themselves by changing an intricate \npattern of bright and dark mottling on their bodies; even clever little \ncreatures from the land who make brief forays into the ocean in vessels \nof wood or metal. But we seek the dominant intelligences, the grandest \ncreatures on the planet, the sentient and graceful masters of the deep \nocean, the great whales.  \nThey are the largest animals11 ever to evolve on the planet Earth, \nlarger by far than the dinosaurs. An adult blue whale can be thirty \nmeters long and weigh 150 tons. Many, especially the baleen whales, \nare placid browsers, straining through vast volumes of ocean for the \nsmall animals on which they graze; others eat fish and krill. The whales \nare recent arrivals in the ocean. Only seventy million years ago their \nancestors were carnivorous  \n* Thus all of the books in the world contain no more information than is \nbroadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all  \nbits have equal value.  \n \n11 Some sequoia trees are both larger and more massive than any whale.  \n \nThe Persistence of Memory \u2014 271 \nmammals who migrated in slow steps from the land into the  \nocean. Among the whales, mothers suckle and care tenderly for their \noffspring. There is a long childhood in which the adults teach the \nyoung. Play is a typical pastime. These are all mammalian \ncharacteristics, all important for the development of intellige nt beings.  \nThe sea is murky. Sight and smell, which work well for mammals \non the land, are not of much use in the depths of the ocean. Those \nancestors of the whales who relied on these senses to locate a mate or \na baby or a predator did not leave many offspring. So a nother method \nwas perfected by evolution; it works superbly well and is central to any \nunderstanding of the whales: the sense of sound. Some whale sounds \nare called songs, but we are still ignorant of their true nature and \nmeaning. They range over a broad  band of frequencies, down to well \nbelow the lowest sound the human ear can detect. A typical whale song \nlasts for perhaps fifteen minutes; the longest, about an hour. Often it \nis repeated, identically, beat for beat, measure for measure, note for \nnote. Oc casionally a group of whales will leave their winter waters in \nthe midst of a song and six months later return to continue at precisely \nthe right note, as if there had been no interruption. Whales are very \ngood at remembering. More often, on their return, the vocalizations \nhave changed. New songs appear on the cetacean hit parade.  \nVery often the members of the group will sing the same song \ntogether. By some mutual consensus, some collaborative song writing, \nthe piece changes month by month, slowly and predictably. These \nvocalizations are complex. If the songs of the humpback whale a re \nenunciated as a tonal language, the total information content, the \nnumber of bits of information in such songs, is some 106 bits, about \nthe same as the information content of the Iliad or the Odyssey.  We \ndo not know what whales or their cousins the dolp hins have to talk or \nsing about. They have no manipulative organs, they make no \nengineering constructs, but they are social creatures. They hunt, swim, fish, browse, frolic, mate, play, run from \npredators. There may be a great deal to \ntalk about.  \nThe \u201csongs\u201d of the humpback whale as \nrecorded on a machine spectrograph.

For 99.99 percent of the history of \nthe whales, there were no humans in or on the deep  oceans. During \nthis period the whales evolved their extraordinary audio \ncommunication system. The finbacks, for example, emit extremely \nloud sounds at a frequency of twenty Hertz, down near the lowest \noctave on the piano keyboard. (A  \nHertz is a unit of sound frequency that represents one sound wave, \none crest and one trough, entering your ear every second.) Such low -\nfrequency sounds are scarcely absorbed in the ocean.  \nThe American biologist Roger Payne has calculated that using the \ndeep ocean sound channel, two whales could communicate with each \nother at twenty Hertz essentially anywhere in the world. One might be \noff the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica and communicate wit h another in \nthe Aleutians. For most of their history, the whales may have \nestablished a global communications network. Perhaps when \nseparated by 15,000 kilometers, their vocalizations are love songs, cast \nhopefully into the vastness of the deep.  \nFor tens of millions of years these enormous, intelligent, \ncommunicative creatures evolved with essentially no natural enemies. \nThen the development of the steamship in the nineteenth century \nintroduced an ominous source of noise pollution. As commercial a nd \nmilitary vessels became more abundant, the noise background in the \noceans, especially at a frequency of twenty Hertz, became noticeable. \nWhales communicating across the oceans must have experienced \nincreasingly greater difficulties. The distance over wh ich they could \ncommunicate must have decreased steadily. Two hundred years ago, a \ntypical distance across which finbacks could communicate was perhaps \n10,000 kilometers. Today, the corresponding number is perhaps a few \nhundred kilometers. Do whales know ea ch other\u2019s names? Can they \nrecognize each other as individuals by sounds alone?  \nWe have cut the whales off from themselves. Creatures that \ncommunicated for tens of millions of years have now effectively been \nsilenced.*  \n \n* There is a curious counterpoint to this story. The preferred radio channel \nfor interstellar communication with other technical civilizations is near a \nfrequency of 1.42 billion Hertz, marked by a radio spectral line of hydrogen, \nthe most abundant atom in  the Universe. We are just beginning to listen here \nfor signals of intelligent origin. But the frequency band is being increasingly \nencroached upon by civilian and military communications traffic on Earth, \nand not only by the major powers. We are jamming t he interstellar channel. \nUncontrolled growth of terrestrial radio technology may prevent us from \nready communication with intelligent beings on distant worlds. Their songs \n469 \u2014 Cosmos  \nmay go unanswered because we have not the \nwill to control our radio -frequency pollution \nand listen.   \nThe Persistence of Memory  \u2014 273 \nAnd we have done worse than that, because there persists to  \nthis day a traffic in the dead bodies of whales. There are humans who \nhunt and slaughter whales and market the products for lipstick or \nindustrial lubricant. Many nations understand that the systematic \nmurder of such intelligent creatures is monstrous, but  the traffic \ncontinues, promoted chiefly by Japan, Norway and the Soviet Union. \nWe humans, as a species, are interested in communication with \nextraterrestrial intelligence. Would not a good  \nbeginning be improved communication with terrestrial intelligence, \nwith other human beings of different cultures and languages, with the \ngreat apes, with the dolphins, but particularly with those intelligent \nmasters of the deep, the great whales?  \nFor a whale to live there are many things it must know how to do. \nThis knowledge is stored in its genes and in its brains. The genetic \ninformation includes how to convert plankton into blubber; or how \nto hold your breath on a dive one kilometer below the s urface. The \ninformation in the brains, the learned information, includes such \nthings as who your mother is, or the meaning of the song you are \nhearing just now. The whale, like all the other animals on the Earth, \nhas a gene library and a brain library.  \nThe genetic material of the whale, like the genetic material of \nhuman beings, is made of nucleic acids, those extraordinary molecules \ncapable of reproducing themselves from the chemical building blocks \nthat surround them, and of turning hereditary informat ion into \naction. For example, one whale enzyme, identi-  \ncal to one you have in every cell of your body, is called hexoki - nase, \nthe first of more than two dozen enzyme -mediated steps  \nrequired to convert a molecule of sugar obtained from the plankton \nin the whale\u2019s diet into a little energy \u2014perhaps a contribution to a \nsingle low -frequency note in the music of the whale.  \nThe information stored in the DNA double helix of a whale or a \nhuman or any other beast or vegetable on Earth is written in a \nlanguage of four letters \u2014the four different kinds of nucleotides, the \nmolecular components that make up DNA. How many bits of \ninformation are contained in the hereditary material of various life \nforms? How many yes/no answers to the various biological questions \nare written in the language of life? A virus needs about 10,000 bits \u2014\nroughly equivalent to the amount of information on this  page. But \nthe viral information is simple, exceedingly compact, extraordinarily \nefficient. Reading it requires very close attention. These are the \ninstructions it needs to infect some other organism and to reproduce \nitself\u2014the only things that viruses are  any good at. A bacterium uses \nroughly a million bits of information \u2014which is about 100 printed pages. Bacteria have a lot more to do \nthan viruses. Unlike the viruses, they \nare not thoroughgoing parasites. \nBacteria have to make a living. And a \nfree-swimmin g one -celled amoeba is \nmuch more sophisticated; with about \nfour hundred million bits in its DNA, it \nwould require some eighty 500 -page \nvolumes to make another amoeba.  \n \nA small region of the Gene Library of a \nhuman or a whale, if it were available as \nordinary books rather than encoded in the \nnucleic acids.

Organisms such as whales and humans that breathe air then combine pyruvate \n(lower right ) with oxygen and extract still more energy. This elaborately evolved chemical pump drives much of life on \nEarth.  474 \u2014 Cosmos  \nA whale or a human being needs something like five billion bits. The \n5 \u00d7 109 bits of information in our encyclopaedia of life \u2014in the nucleus \nof each of our cells \u2014if written out in, say, English, would fill a thousand \nvolumes. Every one of your hundred trillion cells contains a complete \nlibrary of instructions on how to make every part of you. Every cell in \nyour body arises by successive cell divisions from a single cell, a fertilized \negg generated by your parents. Every time that cell divided, in the many \nembryological steps that went into making you, the original set of \ngenetic instructions was duplicated with great fidelity. So your liver cells \nhave some unemployed knowledge about how to make your bone cells, \nand vice versa. The genetic library contains e verything your body knows \nhow to do on its own. The ancient information is written in exhaustive, \ncareful, redundant detail \u2014 how to laugh, how to sneeze, how to walk, \nhow to recognize patterns, how to reproduce, how to digest an apple. If \nit was expressed in the language of chemistry, the instructions for the \nfirst steps in digesting the sugar in an apple would look like the scheme \non pages 274 and 275.  \nEating an apple is an immensely complicated process. In fact, if I had \nto synthesize my own enzymes, if I consciously  had to remember and \ndirect all the chemical steps required to get energy out of food, I would \nprobably starve. But even bacteria do anaerobic glycolysis, which is why \napples rot: lunchtime for the microbes. They and we and all creatures \ninbetween possess many similar genetic instructions. Our separate gene \nlibraries have many pages in common, another reminder of our \ncommon evolutionary heritage. Our technology can duplicate only a \ntiny fraction of the intricate biochemistry that our bodies effortlessly \nperform: we have only just begun to study these processes. Evolution, \nhowever, has had billions of years of practice. DNA knows.  \nBut suppose what you had to do was so complicated that even \nseveral billion bits was insufficient. Suppose the environment was \nchanging so fast that the precoded genetic encyclopaedia, which \nserved perfectly well before, was no longer entirely adequate. Then \neven a gene library of 1,000 volumes would not be enough. That is \nwhy we have brains.  \nLike all our organs, the brain has evolved, increasing in complexity \nand information content, over millions of years. Its structure reflects \nall the stages through which it has passed. The brain evolved from the \ninside out. Deep inside is the oldest part, the brainstem, which \nconducts the basic biological functions, including the rhythms of life \u2014\nheartbeat and respiration. According to a provocative insight by Paul \nMacLean, the higher functions of the brain evolved in three successive \nstages. Capping the bra instem is the R -complex, the seat of aggression, \nritual, territoriality and social hierarchy, which evolved hundreds of \n475 \u2014 Cosmos  \nmillions of years ago in our reptilian ancestors. Deep inside the skull \nof every one   \nThe Persistence of Memory \u2014 211 \nof us there is something like the brain of a crocodile. Surrounding  \nthe R -complex is the limbic system or mammalian brain, which \nevolved tens of millions of years ago in ancestors who were mammals \nbut not yet primates. It is a major source of our moods and emotions, \nof our concern and care for the young.  \nAnd finally, on the outside, living in uneasy truce with the more \nprimitive brains beneath, is the cerebral cortex, which evolved millions \nof years ago in our primate ancestors. The cerebral cortex, where \nmatter is transformed into consciousness, is the po int of embarkation \nfor all our cosmic voyages. Comprising more than two -thirds of the \nbrain mass, it is the realm of both intuition and critical analysis. It is \nhere that we have ideas and inspirations, here that we read and write, \nhere that we do mathemat ics and compose music. The cortex regulates \nour conscious lives. It is the distinction of our species, the seat of our \nhumanity. Civilization is a product of the cerebral cortex.  \nThe language of the brain is not the DNA language of the genes. \nRather, what we know is encoded in cells called neurons \u2014microscopic \nelectrochemical switching elements, typically a few hundredths of a \nmillimeter across. Each of us has perhaps a hundred bill ion neurons, \ncomparable to the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Many \nneurons have thousands of connections with their neighbors. There \nare something like a hundred trillion, 1014, such connections in the \nhuman cerebral cortex.  \nCharles Sherrington imagined the activities in the cerebral cortex \nupon awakening:  \n[The cortex] becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing \npoints with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and \nthither. The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning. \nIt is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. \nSwiftly the  [cortex] becomes an enchanted loom where millions \nof flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a \nmeaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting \nharmony of sub -patterns. Now as the waking body rouses, sub -\npatterns of this great harmo ny of activity stretch down into the \nunlit tracks of the [lower brain]. Strings of flashing and traveling \nsparks engage the links of it. This means that the body is up and \nrises to meet its waking day.  \nEven in sleep, the brain is pulsing, throbbing and flashing with the \ncomplex business of human life \u2014dreaming, remembering, figuring \nthings out. Our thoughts, visions and fantasies have a physical reality. \nA thought is made of hundreds of electrochemical im pulses. If we \nwere shrunk to the level of the neurons, we might witness elaborate, intricate, evanescent patterns. One \nmight be the spark of a memory of the \nsmell of lilacs on a country road in \nchildhood.

The neurochemistry of the brain is \nastonishingly busy, the circuit ry of a \nmachine more wonderful than any \ndevised by humans. But there is no \nevidence that its functioning is due to \nanything more than the 1014 neural \nconnections that build an elegant \narchitecture of consciousness. The \nworld of thought is divided roughly i nto \ntwo hemispheres. The right hemisphere \nof the cerebral cortex is mainly \nresponsible for pattern recognition, \nintuition, sensitivity, creative insights. \nThe left hemisphere presides over \nrational, analytical and critical thinking. \nThese are the dual stre ngths, the \nessential opposites, that characterize \nhuman thinking. Together, they provide the means both for generating ideas and for testing their validity. A \ncontinuous dialogue is going on between the two hemispheres, \nchanneled through an immense bundle of nerves, the corpus \ncallosum, the bridge between creativity and analysis, both of which are \nnecessary to understand the world.  \nThe information content of the human brain expressed in bits is \nprobably comparable to the total number of connections among the \nneurons \u2014about a hundred trillion, 1014, bits. If written out in English, \nsay, that information would fill some twenty million volumes, as many \nas in the world\u2019s largest libraries. The equivalent of twenty million \nbooks is inside the heads of every one of us. The brain is a very big \nplace in a very small space. Most of the books in the brain are in the \ncerebral cortex. Down in the basement are the functions our remote \nancestors mainly depended on \u2014aggression, child -rearing, fear, sex, the \nwillingness to follow leaders blindly. Of the higher brain functions, \nsome - reading, writing, speaking \u2014seem to be localized in particular \nplaces in  the cerebral cortex. Memories, on the other hand, are stored \nredundantly in many locales. If such a thing as telepathy existed, one \nof its glories would be the opportunity for each of us to read the books \nin the cerebral cortices of our loved ones. But th ere is no compelling \nevidence for telepathy, and the communication of such information \nremains the task of artists and writers.  \nThe brain does much more than recollect. It compares, synthesizes, \nanalyzes, generates abstractions. We must figure out much more than \nour genes can know. That is why the brain library is some ten \nthousand times larger than the gene library. Our passion fo r learning, \nevident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival. \nEmotions and ritualized behavior patterns are built deeply into us. \nThey are part of our humanity. But they are not characteristically  \nhuman. Many other animals have feelin gs. What distinguishes our \nspecies is thought. The cerebral cortex is a liberation. We need no \nlonger be trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of \nlizards and baboons. We are, each of us, largely responsible for what  \n \nThe Persistence of Memory \u2014 279 \ngets put into our brains, for what, as adults, we wind up caring for  \nand knowing about. No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we \ncan change ourselves.  \nMost of the world\u2019s great cities have grown haphazardly, little by \nlittle, in response to the needs of the moment; very rarely is a city \nplanned for the remote future. The evolution of a city is like the \nevolution of the brain: it develops from a small cen ter and slowly \ngrows and changes, leaving many old parts still functioning. There is \nno way for evolution to rip out the ancient interior of the brain \nbecause of its imperfections and replace it with something of more \nmodern manufacture. The brain must fun ction during the \nrenovation. That is why the brainstem is surrounded by the R -\ncomplex, then the limbic system and finally the cerebral cortex. The \nold parts are in charge of too many fundamental functions for them \nto be replaced altogether. So they wheeze along, out -of-date and \nsometimes counterproductive, but a necessary consequence of our \nevolution.  \nIn New York City, the arrangement of many of the major streets \ndates to the seventeenth century, the stock exchange to the eighteenth \ncentury, the waterworks to the nineteenth, the electrical power system \nto the twentieth. The arrangement might be more eff icient if all civic \nsystems were constructed in parallel and replaced periodically (which \nis why disastrous fires \u2014the great conflagrations of London and \nChicago, for example \u2014are sometimes an aid in city planning). But the \nslow accretion of new functions pe rmits the city to work more or less \ncontinuously through the centuries. In the seventeenth century you \ntraveled between Brooklyn and Manhattan across the East River by \nferry. In the nineteenth century, the technology became available to \nconstruct a suspens ion bridge across the river. It was built precisely at \nthe site of the ferry terminal, both because the city owned the land \nand because major thoroughfares were already converging on the pre -\nexisting ferry service. Later when it was possible to construct a  tunnel \nunder the river, it too was built in the same place for the same reasons, \nand also because small abandoned precursors of tunnels, called \ncaissons, had already been emplaced during the construction of the \nbridge. This use and restructuring of previo us systems for new \npurposes is very much like the pattern of biological evolution.  \nWhen our genes could not store all the information necessary for \nsurvival, we slowly invented brains. But then the time came, perhaps \nten thousand years ago, when we needed to know more than could \nconveniently be contained in brains. So we learned to stock pile \nenormous quantities of information outside our bodies. We are the \nonly species on the planet, so far as we know, to have invented a communal memory stored neither in \nour genes nor in our brains. The \nwarehouse of that memory is called the \nlibrary.  \nA book is made from a tree. It is an \nassemblage of flat, flexible parts (still \ncalled \u201cleaves\u201d) imprinted with dark \npigmented squiggles.  \nThe constellation of the camel.

Across the millennia, the author \nis speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. \nWriting is perhaps the greatest of human inventio ns, binding together \npeople, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books \nbreak the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.  \nSome of the earliest authors wrote on clay. Cuneiform writing, the \nremote ancestor of the Western alphabet, was invented in the Near \nEast about 5,000 years ago. Its purpose was to keep records: the \npurchase of grain, the sale of land, the triumphs of the k ing, the \nstatutes of the priests, the positions of the stars, the prayers to the gods. \nFor thousands of years, writing was chiseled into clay and stone, \nscratched onto wax or bark or leather; painted on bamboo or papyrus \nor silk \u2014but always one copy at a ti me and, except for the inscriptions \non monuments, always for a tiny readership. Then in China between \nthe second and sixth centuries, paper, ink and printing with carved \nwooden blocks were all invented, permitting many copies of a work to \nbe made and distr ibuted. It took a thousand years for the idea to catch \non in remote and backward Europe. Then, suddenly, books were \nbeing printed all over the world. Just before the invention of movable \ntype, around 1450, there were no more than a few tens of thousands \nof books in all of Europe, all handwritten; about as many as in China \nin 100 B.C., and a tenth as many as in the Great Library of Alexandria. \nFifty years later, around 1500, there were ten million printed books. \nLearning had become available to anyone who could read. Magic was \neverywhere.  \nMore recently, books, especially paperbacks, have been printed in \nmassive and inexpensive editions. For the price of a modest meal you \ncan ponder the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, the origin of \nspecies, the interpretation of dreams, the nature of t hings. Books are \nlike seeds. They can lie dormant for centuries and then flower in the \nmost unpromising soil.  \nThe great libraries of the world contain millions of volumes, the \nequivalent of about 1014 bits of information in words, and perhaps \n1015 bits in pictures. This is ten thousand times more information \nthan in our genes, and about ten times more than in our brains. If I \nfinish a book a week, I will read only a few thousand books in my \nlifetime, about a tenth of a percent of the contents of th e greatest \nlibraries of our time. The trick is to know which books to read. The \ninformation in books is not preprogramm ed at birth but constantly \nchanged, amended by events, adapted to the world. It is now twenty -\nthree centuries since the founding of the Alexandrian Library. If there were no books, no written records, \n \nthink how prodigious a time twenty -three centuries would be. With four generations per century, twenty -\nthree centuries occupies almost a hundred generations of human beings. If information could be passed \non merely by word of  483 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nTwo pages from a nineteenth -century Thai \nmanuscript on astrology and astronomy. \nCourtesy Spencer Collection, the New York \nPublic Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden \nFoundations.  \nmouth, how little we should know of our \npast, how slow would be our progress! \nEverything would depend on what \nancient findings we had accidentally \nbeen told about, and how accurate the \naccount was. Past information might be \nrevered, but in successive retel lings it \nwould become progressively more \nmuddled and eventually lost. Books \npermit us to voyage through time, to tap \nthe wisdom of our ancestors. The library \nconnects us with the insights and \nknowledge, painfully extracted from \nNature, of the greatest mind s that ever \nwere, with the best teachers, drawn from \nthe entire planet and from all of our \nhistory, to instruct us without tiring, and \nto inspire us to make our own \ncontribution to the collective knowledge \nof the human species. Public libraries \ndepend on v oluntary contributions. I \nthink the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and \nour concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support \nour libraries.  \nWere the Earth to be started over again with all its physical features \nidentical, it is extremely unlikely that anything closely resembling a \nhuman being would ever again emerge. There is a powerful random \ncharacter to the evolutionary process. A cosmic ra y striking a different \ngene, producing a different mutation, can have small consequences \nearly but profound consequences late. Happenstance may play a \npowerful role in biology, as it does in history. The farther back the \ncritical events occur, the more po werfully can they influence the \npresent.  \nFor example, consider our hands. We have five fingers, including \none opposable thumb. They serve us quite well. But I think we would \nbe served equally well with six fingers including a thumb, or four \nfingers including a thumb, or maybe five fingers and two  thumbs. \nThere is nothing intrinsically best about our particular configuration \nof fingers, which we ordinarily think of as so natural and inevitable. \nWe have five fingers because we have descended from a Devonian fish \nthat had five phalanges or bones in i ts fins. Had we descended from a \nfish with four or six phalanges, we would have four or six fingers on \neach hand and would think them perfectly natural. We use base ten \narithmetic only because we have ten fingers on our hands.* Had the \narrangement been oth erwise, we would use base eight or base twelve \narithmetic and relegate base ten to the New Math. The same point \napplies, I believe, to many more essential aspects of our being \u2014our \nhereditary material, our internal biochemistry, our form, stature, \norgan sys tems, loves and hates, passions and despairs, tenderness and \naggression, even our analytical processes \u2014all of these are, at least in \npart, the result of apparently minor accidents in our immensely long \nevolutionary history.  \n* The arithmetic based on the number 5 or 10 seems so obvious that the \nancient Greek equivalent of \u201cto count\u201d literally means \u201cto five.\u201d  \n484 \u2014 Cosmos  \nThe Persistence of  Memory  \u2014 283 \nPerhaps if one less dragonfly had drowned in the Carboniferous \nswamps, the intelligent organisms on our planet today would have \nfeathers and teach their young in rookeries. The pattern of \nevolutionary causality is a web of astonishing complexity; the \nincom pleteness of our understanding humbles us.  \nJust sixty -five million years ago our ancestors were the most \nunprepossessing of mammals \u2014creatures with the size and intelligence \nof moles or tree shrews. It would have taken a very audacious biologist \nto guess that such animals would eventually produce th e line that \ndominates the Earth today. The Earth then  \nwas full of awesome, nightmarish lizards \u2014the dinosaurs, immensely \nsuccessful creatures, which filled virtually every ecological niche. \nThere were swimming reptiles, flying reptiles, and reptiles \u2014some as \ntall as a six -story building \u2014thundering across the fa ce of the Earth. \nSome of them had rather large brains, an upright posture and two \nlittle front legs very much like hands, which they used to catch small, \nspeedy mammals \u2014probably including our distant ancestors \u2014for \ndinner. If such dinosaurs had survived, pe rhaps the dominant \nintelligent species on our planet today would be four meters tall with \ngreen skin and sharp teeth, and the human form would be considered \na lurid fantasy of saurian science fiction. But the dinosaurs did not \nsurvive. In one catastrophic event all of them and many, perhaps most, \nof the other species on the Earth, were destroyed.* But not the tree \nshrews. Not the mammals. They survived.  \nNo one knows what wiped out the dinosaurs. One evocative idea is \nthat it was a cosmic catastrophe, the explosion of a nearby star \u2014a \nsupernova like the one that produced the Crab Nebula. If there were \nby chance a supernova within ten or twenty light - years of the solar \nsystem some sixty -five million years ago, it would have sprayed an \nintense flux of cosmic rays into space, and some of these, entering the \nEarth\u2019s envelope of air, would have burned the atmospheric nitrogen. \nThe oxides of nitrogen thus generat ed would have removed the \nprotective layer of ozone from the atmosphere, increasing the flux of \nsolar ultraviolet radiation at the surface and frying and mutating the \nmany organisms imperfectly protected against intense ultraviolet light. \nSome of those org anisms may have been staples of the dinosaur diet.  \nThe disaster, whatever it was, that cleared the dinosaurs from the \nworld stage removed the pressure on the mammals. Our ancestors no \nlonger had to live in the shadow of voracious reptiles. We diversified \nexuberantly and flourished. Twenty million years ago , our immediate \nancestors probably still lived in the trees, later descending because the \nforests receded during a major  \n \n* A recent analysis suggests that 96 percent of all the species in the oceans \nmay have died at this time. With such an enormous extinction rate, the  \norganisms of today can have evolved from only a small and unrepresentative \nsampling of the organisms that lived in late Mesozoic times.

It is not much good to \nbe supremely adapted to life in the trees if there are very few trees. Many \narboreal primates must have vanished with the forests. A few eked out \na precarious existence on the ground and  survived. And one of those \nlines evolved to become us. No one knows the cause of that climatic \nchange. It may have been a small variation in the intrinsic luminosity \nof the Sun or in the orbit of the Earth; or massive volcanic eruptions \ninjecting fine dus t into the stratosphere, reflecting more sunlight back \ninto space and cooling the Earth. It may have been due to changes in \nthe general circulation of the oceans. Or perhaps the passage of the \nSun through a galactic dust cloud. Whatever the cause, we see a gain \nhow tied our existence is to random astronomical and geological \nevents.  After we came down from the trees, \nwe evolved an upright posture; our \nhands were free; we possessed excellent \nbinocular vision \u2014we had acquired many \nof the preconditions for making tools. \nThere was now a real advantage in \npossessing a large brain and in \ncommunicating complex thoughts. \nOther things being equal, it is better to \nbe smart than to be stupid. Intelligent \nbeings can solve problems better, live \nlonger and leave more offspring; until \nthe invention of nuclear weapons, \nintelligence powerfully aided sur vival. \nIn our history it was some horde of furry \nlittle mammals who hid from the \ndinosaurs, colonized the treetops and \nlater scampered down to domesticate \nfire, invent writing, construct \nobservatories and launch space vehicles. \nIf things had been a little different, it \nmight have been some other creature \nwhose intelligence and manipulative \nability would have led to  \ncomparable accomplishments. Perhaps \nthe smart bipedal dinosaurs, or the \nraccoons, or the otters, or the squid. It \nwould be nice to know how different \nother intelligences can be; so we study \nthe whales and the great apes. To learn \na little about what other  \nkinds of civilizations are possible, we can \nstudy history and cultural anthropology. \nBut we are all of us \u2014us whales, us apes, \nus people \u2014too closely related. As long as \nour inquiries are limited to one or two \nevolutionary lines on a single planet, we \nwill r emain forever ignorant of the \npossible range and brilliance of other \nintelligences and other civilizations.  \nOn another planet, with a different \nsequence of random processes to make \nhereditary diversity and a different \nenvironment to select particular \ncombinations of genes, the chances of \nfinding beings who are physically very \nsimilar to us is, I believe, near ze ro. The \nchances of finding another form of \nintelligence is not. Their brains may well \n486 \u2014 Cosmos  \nhave evolved from the inside out. They may have switching elements \nanalogous to our neurons. But the neurons may be very different; \nperhaps superconductors that work at very low temperatures rather \nthan organic devices that work at room temperature, in whi ch case \ntheir speed of thought will be 107 times faster than ours. Or perhaps \nthe equivalent of   \nThe Persistence of Memory  \u2014 \n285 \n \nneurons elsewhere would not be in direct physical contact but in \nradio communication so that a single intelligent being could be \ndistributed among many different organisms, or even many different \nplanets, each with a part of the intelligence of the whole, each \ncontributing by radio to an intelligence much greater than itself.* \nThere may be planets where the intelligent beings have about 1014 \nneural connections, as we do. But there may be places where the \nnumber is 1024 or 1034. I wonder what they would know. Because we \ninhabit the same universe as they, we and they must share some \nsubstantial information in common. If we could make contact, there \nis much in their brains that would be of great interest to ours. But the \nopposite i s also true. I think extraterrestrial intelligence \u2014even beings \nsubstantially further evolved than we \u2014will be interested in us, in what \nwe know, how we think, what our brains are like, the course of our \nevolution, the prospects for our future.  \nIf there are intelligent beings on the planets of fairly nearby stars, \ncould they know about us? Might they somehow have an inkling of \nthe long evolutionary progression from genes to brains to libraries \nthat has occurred on the obscure planet Earth? If the  extraterrestrials \nstay at home, there are at least two ways in which they might find out \nabout us. One way would be to listen with large radio telescopes. For \nbillions of years they would have heard only weak and intermittent \nradio static caused by light ning and the trapped electrons and protons \nwhistling within the Earths magnetic field. Then, less than a century \nago, the radio waves leaving the Earth would become stronger, louder, \nless like noise and more like signals. The inhabitants of Earth had \nfinally stumbled upon radio communication. Today there is a vast \ninternational radio, television and radar communications traffic. At \nsome radio frequencies the Earth has become by far the brightest  * In some sense such a radio integration of \nseparate individuals is already beginning to \nhappen on the planet Earth.  \nThe death of the dinosaurs. In one \nastronomical hypothesis, it was due to a \nnearby supernova explosion, seen in this \npainting by Don Davis in the sky at top \nright. In another hypothesis a large \nasteroid strikes the Earth; the fine debris \nfrom the impact pe rsists in the \nstratosphere, reduces sunlight available for \nplants the dinosaurs eat, and cools the \nEarth. Over hundreds of millions of years, \nboth events must have happened at least \nonce. The extinction of bipedal intelligent \nreptiles cleared the stage for  the evolution \nof mammals and humans.  \n488 \u2014 Cosmos  \nobject, the most powerful radio source, in the solar system - brighter \nthan Jupiter, brighter than the Sun. An extraterrestrial civilization \nmonitoring the radio emission from Earth and receiving such signals \ncould not fail to conclude that something intere sting had been \nhappening here lately.  \nAs the Earth rotates, our more powerful radio transmitters slowly \nsweep the sky. A radio astronomer on a planet of another star would \nbe able to calculate the length of the day on Earth from the times of \nappearance and disappearance of our signals. Some of  our most \npowerful sources are radar transmitters; a few are used for radar \nastronomy, to probe with radio fingers the surfaces of the nearby \nplanets. The size of the radar beam projected against the sky is much \nlarger than the size of the planets, and muc h of the signal wafts on, \nout of the solar system into the depths of interstellar space to any \nsensitive receivers that may be listening. Most radar transmissions are \nfor military purposes; they scan the skies in constant fear of a massive \nlaunch of missil es with nuclear warheads, an augury fifteen minutes \nearly of the end of human civilization. The information content of \nthese pulses is negligible: a succession of simple numerical patterns \ncoded into beeps.  \nOverall, the most pervasive and noticeable source of radio \ntransmissions from the Earth is our television programming. Because \nthe Earth is turning, some television stations will appear at one \nhorizon of the Earth while others disappear over the other. The re will \nbe a confused jumble of programs. Even these might be sorted out and \npieced together by an advanced civilization on a planet of a nearby \nstar. The most frequently repeated messages will be station call signals \nand appeals to purchase detergents, de odorants, headache tablets, and \nautomobile and petroleum products. The most noticeable messages \nwill be those broadcast simultaneously by many transmitters in many \ntime zones \u2014for example, speeches in times of international crisis by \nthe President of the Un ited States or the Premier of the Soviet Union. \nThe mindless contents of commercial television and the integuments \nof international crisis and internecine warfare within the human \nfamily are the principal messages about life on Earth that we choose \nto broa dcast to the Cosmos. What must they think of us?  \nThere is no calling those television programs back. There is no way \nof sending a faster message to overtake them and revise the previous \ntransmission. Nothing can travel faster than light. Large -scale \ntelevision transmission on the planet Earth began only in the late \n1940\u2019s. Thus, there is a spherical wave front centered on the Earth \nexpanding at the speed of light and containing Howdy Doody, the \n\u201cCheckers\u201d speech of then Vice -President Richard M. Nixon and the \ntelevised inquisitions by Senator Joseph McCar thy. Because these 489 \u2014 Cosmos  \ntransmissions were broadcast a few decades ago, they are only a few \ntens of light -years away from the Earth. If the nearest civilization is \nfarther away than   \nThe Persistence of  Memory  \u2014 287 \nthat, then we can continue to breathe easy for a while. In any case, we \ncan hope that they will find these programs incomprehensible.  \nThe two Voyager spacecraft are bound for the stars. Affixed to each \nis a gold -plated copper phonograph record with a cartridge and stylus \nand, on the aluminum record jacket, instructions for use. We sent \nsomething about our genes, something about our brain s, and \nsomething about our libraries to other beings who might sail the sea \nof interstellar space. But we did not want to send primarily scientific \ninformation. Any civilization able to intercept Voyager in the depths \nof interstellar space, its transmitter s long dead, would know far more \nscience than we do. Instead, we wanted to tell those other beings \nsomething about what seems unique about ourselves. The interests of \nthe cerebral cortex and limbic system are well represented; the R -\ncomplex less so. Althou gh the recipients may not know any languages \nof the Earth, we included greetings in sixty human tongues, as well as \nthe hellos of the humpback whales. We sent photographs of humans \nfrom all over the world caring for one another, learning, fabricating \ntools  and art and responding to challenges. There is an hour and a \nhalf of exquisite music from many cultures, some of it expressing our \nsense of cosmic loneliness, our wish to end our isolation, our longing \nto make contact with other beings in the Cosmos. And we have sent \nrecordings of the sounds that would have been heard on our planet \nfrom the earliest days before the origin of life to the evolution of the \nhuman species and our most recent burgeoning technology. It is, as \nmuch as the sounds of any baleen whal e, a love song cast upon the \nvastness of the deep. Many, perhaps most, of our messages will be \nindecipherable. But we have sent them because it is important to try.  \nIn this spirit we included on the Voyager spacecraft the thoughts \nand feelings of one person, the electrical activity of her brain, heart, \neyes and muscles, which were recorded for an hour, transcribed into \nsound, compressed in time and incorporated into t he record. In one \nsense we have launched into the Cosmos a direct transcription of the \nthoughts and feelings of a single human being in the month of June \nin the year 1977 on the planet Earth. Perhaps the recipients will make \nnothing of it, or think it is a  recording of a pulsar, which in some \nsuperficial sense it resembles. Or perhaps a civilization unimaginably \nmore advanced than ours will be able to decipher such recorded \nthoughts and feelings and appreciate our efforts to share ourselves \nwith them.  \nThe information in our genes is very old \u2014most of it more than \nmillions of years old, some of it billions of years old. In contrast, the \ninformation in our books is at most thousands of years old, and that \nin our brains is only decades old. The long -lived i nformation is not \nthe characteristically human information. Because of erosion on the \nEarth, our monuments and artifacts will not, in the natural course of \nthings, survive to the distant future. But the  \n288 \u2014 Cosmos   \n \n \n \nThe Persistence of Memory \u2014 289 \nVoyager record is on its way out of the solar system. The erosion in \ninterstellar space \u2014chiefly cosmic rays and impacting dust grains \u2014is so \nslow that the information on the record will last a billion years. Genes \nand brains and books encode information dif ferently and persist \nthrough time at different rates. But the persistence of the memory of \nthe human species will be far longer in the impressed metal grooves \non the Voyager interstellar re-  \ncord.  \nThe Voyager message is traveling with agonizing slowness. The \nfastest object ever launched by the human species, it will still take tens \nof thousands of years to go the distance to the nearest star. Any \ntelevision program will traverse in hours the distanc e that Voyager has \ncovered in years. A television transmission that has just finished being \naired will, in only a few hours, overtake the Voyager spacecraft in the \nregion of Saturn and beyond and speed outward to the stars. If it is \nheaded that way, the si gnal will reach Alpha Centauri in a little more \nthan four years. If, some decades or centuries hence, anyone out there \nin space hears our television broadcasts, I hope they will think well of \nus, a product of fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution,  \nthe local transmogrification of matter into consciousness. Our \nintelligence has recently provided us with awesome powers. It is not \nyet clear that we have the wisdom to avoid our own self -de- struction. \nBut many of us are trying very hard. We hope that ver y soon in the \nperspective of cosmic time we will have unified our planet peacefully \ninto an organization cherishing the life of every living creature on it \nand will be ready to take that next great step, to become part of a \ngalactic society of communicatin g civilizations.  \nThe Voyager interstellar record.

On November 16, 1974, a radio signal was transmitted from the Arecibo \n \nObservatory to the globular cluster Ml3, about 25,000 light -years distant, far from the plane of the Milky Way \nGalaxy. The signal contained 1,679 bits of information. But 1,679 = 73 \u00d7 23, the product of two prime numbers, \nsuggesting that the bits be arrang ed in a 73 \u00d7 23 array, which yields this picture. The top row establishes a binary \ncounting convention; the second specifies the atomic numbers of the chemical elements hydrogen, carbon, \nnitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus, of which we are made (Chapter 9). In  these terms, the green and blue blocks \nrepresent, respectively and numerically, the nucleotides and the sugar -phosphate backbone of DNA (Chapter 2). \nThe vertical white block represents the number of nucleotides in the genes of the red creature, of which t he total \npopulation is the number to its right; and which is as tall as the number to its left (in units of the wavelength of \nthe transmission, 12.6 centimeters).

But in the future we will do better. \nOur ships will travel faster. There will be designated interstellar \nobjectives, and sooner or later our spacecraft will have human crews. \nIn the Milky Way Galaxy there must be many planets millions of years \nolder than Earth, and some that are billions of years older. Should we \nnot have been visit ed? In all the billions of years since the origin of our \nplanet, has there not been even once a strange craft from a distant \ncivilization surveying our world from above, and slowly settling down \nto the surface to be observed by iridescent dragonflies, incu rious \nreptiles, screeching primates or wondering humans? The idea is \nnatural enough. It has occurred to everyone who has contemplated, \neven casually, the question of intelligent life in the universe. But has \nit happened in fact? The critical issue is the q uality of the purported \nevidence, rigorously and skeptically scrutinized \u2014not what sounds \nplausible, not the unsubstantiated testimony of one or two self -\nprofessed eyewitnesses. By this standard there are no compelling cases \nof extraterrestrial visitation, despite all the claims about UFOs and \nancient astronauts which sometimes make it seem that our planet is \nawash in uninvited guests. I wish it were otherwise. There is  \nsomething irresistible about the discovery of even a token, perhaps a \ncomplex inscription, but, best by far, a key to the understanding of an \nalien and exotic civilization. It is an appeal we humans have felt before.  \nIn 1801 a physicist named Joseph Fourier* was the prefect of a  \n \n* Fourier is now famous for his study of the propagation of heat in solids, \nused today to understand the surface properties of the planets, and for his \ninvestigation of waves and other periodic motion \u2014a branch of mathematics \nknown as Fourier analysis.  \n \ndepartement  of France called Is\u00e8re. While inspecting the schools in his \nprovince, Fourier discovered an eleven -year-old boy whose remarkable \nintellect and flair for oriental languages had already earned him the \nadmiring attention of scholars. Fourier invited him home  for a chat. \nThe boy was fascinated by Fourier\u2019s collection of Egyptian artifacts, \ncollected during the Napoleonic expedition where he had been \nresponsible for cataloging the astronomical monuments of that \nancient civilization. The hieroglyphic inscription s roused the boy\u2019s \nsense of wonder. \u201cBut what do they mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cNobody \nknows,\u201d was the reply. The boy\u2019s name was Jean Francois \nChampollion. Fired by the mystery of the language no one could read, \nhe became a superb linguist and passionately immerse d himself in \nancient Egyptian writing. France at that time was flooded with \nEgyptian artifacts, stolen by  \nNapoleon and later made available to Western scholars. The \ndescription of the expedition was published, and devoured by the \nyoung Champollion. As an adult, Champollion succeeded; fulfilling \nhis childhood ambition, he provided a brilliant decipherment of th e \nancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. But it was not until 1828, twenty -\nseven years after his meeting with Fourier, that Champollion first set \nfoot in Egypt, the land of his dreams, and sailed upstream from Cairo, \nfollowing the course of the Nile, paying homag e to the culture he had \nworked so hard to understand. It was an expedition in time, a visit to \nan alien civilization:  \nThe evening of the 16th we finally arrived at Dendera. There \nwas magnificent moonlight and we were only an hour away from \nthe Temples: Could we resist the tempta-  \ntion? I ask the coldest of you mortals! To dine and leave \nimmediately were the orders of the moment: alone and without \nguides, but armed to the teeth we crossed the fields . . . the \nTemple appeared to us at last . . . One could well measure it but \nto give an idea of it would be impossible. It is the union of grace \nand majesty in the highest degree. We stayed there two hours in \necstasy, running through the huge rooms . . . and trying to read \nthe exterior inscriptions in the moonlight. We did not return \nto th e boat until three in the morning, only to return to the \nTemple at seven . . . What had been magnificent in the \nmoonlight was still so when the sunlight revealed to us all the \ndetails . . .

Many before him had tried and failed \nto decipher the lovely hieroglyphics, a word that means \u201csacred  \ncarvings.\u201d Some scholars had believed them to be a kind   \n294 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \nThe Rosetta stone, made of black basalt \nand about a meter high (top) shows the \nsame inscription in Egyptian hieroglyphics, Demotic and Greek. Each cartouche in the hieroglyphic text (above \nfinger, middle ) corresponds to the name Ptolemy  \n(Ptolemaios) in the Greek text (above finger, bottom ). \nof picture code, rich in murky metaphor, mostly about eyeballs and \nwavy lines, beetles, bumblebees and birds \u2014especially birds. Confusion \nwas rampant. There were those who deduced that the Egyptians were \ncolonists from ancient China. There were those who co ncluded the \nopposite. Enormous folio volumes of spurious translations were \npublished. One interpreter glanced at the Rosetta stone, whose \nhieroglyphic inscription was then still undeciphered, and instantly \nannounced its meaning. He said that the quick deci pherment enabled \nhim \u201cto avoid the systematic errors which invariably arise from \nprolonged reflection.\u201d You get better results, he argued, by not \nthinking too much. As with the search for extraterrestrial life today, \nthe unbridled speculation of amateurs h ad frightened many \nprofessionals out of the field.  \nChampollion resisted the idea of hieroglyphs as pictorial \nmetaphors. Instead, with the aid of a brilliant insight by the English \nphysicist Thomas Young, he proceeded something like this: The \nRosetta stone had been uncovered in 1799 by a French soldier \nwork ing on the fortifications of the Nile Delta town of Rashid, which \nthe Europeans, largely ignorant of Arabic, called Rosetta. It was a slab \nfrom an ancient temple, displaying what seemed clearly to be the same \nmessage in three different writings: in hierogl yphics at top, in a kind \nof cursive hieroglyphic called demotic in the middle, and, the key to \nthe enterprise, in Greek at the bottom. Champollion, who was fluent \nin ancient Greek, read that the stone had been inscribed to \ncommemorate the coronation of Pto lemy V Epiphanes, in the spring \nof the year 196 B.C.   On this occasion the king released political \nprisoners, remitted taxes, endowed temples, forgave rebels, increased \nmilitary preparedness and, in short, did all the things that modern \nrulers do when they  wish to stay in office.  \nThe Greek text mentions Ptolemy many times. In roughly the \nsame positions in the hieroglyphic text is a set of symbols surrounded \nby an oval or cartouche. This, Champollion reasoned, very probably \nalso denotes Ptolemy. If so, the writing could not be funda mentally \npictographic or metaphorical; rather, most of the symbols must stand \nfor letters or syllables. Champollion also had the presence of mind to \ncount up the number of Greek words and the number of individual \nhieroglyphs in what were presumably equival ent texts. There were \nmany fewer of the former, again suggesting that the hieroglyphs were \nmainly letters and syllables. But which hieroglyphs correspond to \nwhich letters? Fortunately, Champollion had available to him an \nobelisk, which had been excavated a t Philae, that included the \nhieroglyphic equivalent of the Greek name Cleopatra. The two \n \ncartouches for Ptolemy and for Cleopatra, \nrearranged so they both read left to right, \nare shown on p. 296. Ptolemy begins with \nP; the first symbol in the cartouche is a \nsquare. Cleopatra has for its fifth letter a P, \nand in the Cleopatra cartouche in the f ifth \nposition is the same square. P it is. The \nfourth letter in Ptolemy is an L.

The second \nletter of Cleopatra is an L and, in \nhieroglyphics, here is a lion again. The \neagle is an A, appearing twice in \nCleopatra, as it should. A clear pattern is \nemerging. Egyptian hieroglyphics are, in \nsignificant part, a simp le substitution \ncipher. But not every hieroglyph is a \nletter or syllable. Some are pictographs. \nThe end of the Ptolemy cartouche means \n\u201cEver -living, beloved of the god Ptah.\u201d \nThe semicircle and egg at the end of \nCleopatra are a conventional ideogram \nfor \u201cdaughter of Isis.\u201d This mix of letters \nand pictographs caused some grief for \nearlier interpreters.  \nIn retrospect it sounds almost easy. \nBut it had taken many centuries to figure \nout, and there was a great deal more to \ndo, especially in the decipherment of the \nhieroglyphs of much earlier times. The \ncartouches were the key within the key, \nalmost as if the  pharaohs of Egypt had \ncircled their own names to make the \ngoing easier for the Egyptologists two \nthousand years in the future. \nChampollion walked the Great \nHypostyle Hall at Karnak and casually \nread the inscriptions, which had \nmystified everyone else, ans wering the \nquestion he had posed as a child to \nFourier. What a joy it must have been to \nopen this one -way communication channel with another civilization, to permit a culture that had been \nmute for millennia to speak of its history, magic, medicine, religion, \npolitics and philosophy.  \nToday we are again seeking messages from an ancient and exotic \ncivilization, this time hidden from us not only in time but also in \nspace. If we should receive a radio message from an extraterrestrial \ncivilization, how could it possibly be understood? Extra terrestrial \nintelligence will be elegant, complex, internally consistent and utterly \nalien. Extraterrestrials would, of course, wish to make a message sent \nto us as comprehensible as possible. But how could they? Is there in \nany sense an interstellar Roset ta stone? We believe there is. We believe \nthere is a common language that all technical civilizations, no matter \nhow different, must have. That common language is science and \nmathematics. The laws of Nature are the same everywhere. The \npatterns in the spec tra of distant stars and galaxies are the same as \nthose for the Sun or for appropriate laboratory experiments: not only \ndo the same chemical elements exist everywhere in the universe, but \nalso the same laws of quantum mechanics that govern the absorption \nand emission of radiation by atoms apply everywhere as well. Distant \ngalaxies revolving about one another follow the same laws of \ngravitational physics as govern the motion of an apple falling to Earth, \nor Voyager on its way to the stars. The patterns of Na ture are \neverywhere the same. An interstellar message, intended to be \nunderstood by an emerging civilization, should be easy to decode.  \nWe do not expect an advanced technical civilization on any other \nplanet in our solar system. If one were only a little behind us \u201410,000 \nyears, say \u2014it would have no advanced technology at exploring the solar \nsystem \u2014its representatives should by now be here.  To communicate \nwith other civilizations, we require a method adequate not merely for \ninterplanetary distances but for interstellar distances. Ideally, the \nmethod should be inexpensive, so that a huge amount of information \ncould be sent and received at ver y little cost; fast, so an interstellar \ndialogue is rendered possible; and obvious, so any technological \ncivilization, no matter what its evolutionary path, will discover it early. \nSurprisingly,  \nthere is such a method. It is called radio astronomy.  \nThe largest semi -steerable radio/radar observatory on the planet \nEarth is the Arecibo facility, which Cornell University operates for the \nNational Science Foundation. In the remote hinterland of the island \nof Puerto Rico, it is 305 meters (a thousand feet)  across, its reflecting \nsurface a section of a sphere laid down in a pre -existing bowl -shaped \nvalley. It receives radio waves from the depths of space, focusing them \nonto the feed arm antenna high above the dish, which is in turn \nelectronically connected t o the control room, where the signal is \nanalyzed. Alternatively, when the telescope is used as a radar \nEncyclopaedia Galactica  \u2014 297 \nall. If it were only a little ahead of us \u2014we who are already   \ntransmitter, the feed arm can broadcast a \nsignal into the dish, which reflects it into \nspace. The Arecibo Observatory has \nbeen used both to search for intelligent \nsignals from civilizations in space and, \njust once, to broadcast a message \u2014to \nM13, a distant globular cluster of stars, \nso that our technical capability to engage \nin both sides of an interstellar dialogue \nwould be clear, at least to us.  \nIn a period of a few weeks, the \nArecibo Observatory could transmit to a \ncomparable observatory on a planet of a \nnearby star all of the Encyclopaedia \nBritannica . Radio waves travel at the \nspeed of light, 10,000 times faster than a \nmessage attached to our fastest \ninterstellar spaceship. Radio telescopes \ngenerate, in narrow frequency ranges, \nsignals so intense they can be detected \nover immense interstellar distance s. The \nArecibo Observatory could \ncommunicate with an identical radio \ntelescope on a planet 15,000  light-years \naway, halfway to the center of the Milky \nWay Galaxy, if we knew precisely where \nto point it. And radio astronomy is a \nnatural technology. Virtually any \nplanetary atmosphere, no matter what its \ncomposition, should be partially \ntransparent to ra dio waves. Radio \nmessages are not much absorbed or \nscattered by the gas between the stars, \njust as a San Francisco radio station can \nbe heard easily in Los Angeles even when \nsmog there has reduced the visibility at \noptical wavelengths to a few kilometers. \nThere are many natural cosmic radio \nsources having nothing to do with \nintelligent life \u2014pulsars and quasars, the \nradiation belts of planets and the outer \natmospheres of stars; from almost any \nplanet there are bright radio sources to \ndiscover early in the lo cal development \nof radio astronomy. Moreover, radio \nrepresents a large fraction of the \nelectromagnetic spectrum. Any technology able to detect radiation of any wavelength would fairly \nsoon  \n \nThe Arecibo radio/radar observatory in  \nPuerto Rico.

Advanced \ncivilizations may have graduated far beyond radio for their own \ncommunications. But radio is powerful, cheap, fast and simple. They \nwill know that a backward civilization like ours, wishing to receive \nmessages from the skies, is likely to tu rn first to radio technology. \nPerhaps they will have to wheel the radio telescopes out of the \nMuseum of Ancient Technology. If we were to receive a radio message \nwe would know that there would be at the very least one thing we \ncould talk about: radio astro nomy.  \nBut is there anyone out there to talk to? With a third or half a \ntrillion stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone, could ours be the only \none accompanied by an inhabited planet? How much more likely it is \nthat technical civilizations are a cosmic commonplace, that the Galaxy \nis pulsing and humming with advanced societies, and, therefore, that \nthe nearest such culture is not so very far away \u2014perhaps transmitting \nfrom antennas established on a planet of a naked -eye star just next \ndoor. Perhaps when we look up at the sky at night, near one of those \nfaint pinpoints of light is a world on which someone quite different \nfrom us is then glancing idly at a star we call the Sun and entertaining, \nfor just a moment, an outrageous speculation.  \nIt is very hard to be sure. There may be severe impediments to the \nevolution of a technical civilization. Planets may be rarer than we \nthink. Perhaps the origin of life is not so easy as our laboratory \nexperiments suggest. Perhaps the evolution of advanced  life forms is \nimprobable. Or it may be that complex life forms evolve readily, but \nintelligence and technical societies require an unlikely set of \ncoincidences \u2014just as the evolution of the human species depended on \nthe demise of the dinosaurs and the ice -age recession of the forests in \nwhose trees our ancestors screeched and dimly wondered. Or perhaps \ncivilizations arise repeatedly, inexorably, on innumerable planets in \nthe Milky Way, but are generally unstable; so all but a tiny fraction are \nunable to sur vive their technology and succumb to greed and \nignorance, pollution and nuclear war.  \nIt is possible to explore this great issue further and make a crude \nestimate of N, the number of advanced technical civilizations in the \nGalaxy. We define an advanced civilization as one capable of radio \nastronomy. This is, of course, a parochial if essent ial definition. There \nmay be countless worlds on which the inhabitants are accomplished \nlinguists or superb poets but indifferent radio astronomers. We will 509 \u2014 Cosmos  \nnot hear from them. N can be written as the product or multiplication \nof a number of factors,  510 \nEncyclopaedia Galactica  \u2014  \neach a kind of filter, every one of which must be sizable for there to be a \nlarge number of civilizations:  \nN*, the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy; f p, the \nfraction of stars that have planetary systems; n e, the number of \nplanets in a given system that are ecologically suitable for life;  \nfl, the fraction of otherwise suitable planets on which life actually arises;  \nfi, the fraction of inhabited planets on which an intelligent form of \nlife evolves;  \nfc, the fraction of planets inhabited by intelligent beings on \nwhich a communicative technical civilization develops; and  \nfL, the fraction of a planetary lifetime graced by a technical civilization.  \nWritten out, the equation reads N = N *fpneflfifcfL. All the f\u2019s are fractions, \nhaving values between 0 and 1; they will pare down  \nthe large value of N *. \nTo derive N we must estimate each of these quantities. We know a \nfair amount about the early factors in the equation, the numbers of \nstars and planetary systems. We know very little about the later factors, \nconcerning the evolution of intelligence or the l ifetime of technical \nsocieties. In these cases our estimates will be little better than guesses. \nI invite you, if you disagree with my estimates below, to make your \nown choices and see what implications your alternative suggestions \nhave for the number of a dvanced civilizations in the Galaxy. One of \nthe great virtues of this equation, due originally to Frank Drake of \nCornell, is that it involves subjects ranging from stellar and planetary \nastronomy to organic chemistry, evolutionary biology, history, politic s \nand abnormal psychology. Much of the Cosmos is in the span of the \nDrake equation.  \nWe know N *, the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, fairly well, \nby careful counts of stars in small but representative  \nregions of the sky. It is a few hundred billion; some recent estimates \nplace it at 4 \u00d7 1011. Very few of these stars are of the massive short -\nlived variety that squander their reserves of thermonuclear fuel. The \ngreat majority have lifetimes of billions or more years in which they \nare shining stably, providing a suitable energy source for the or igin \nand evolution of life on nearby planets.  \nThere is evidence that planets are a frequent accompaniment of star \nformation: in the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, \nwhich are like miniature solar systems; in theories of the origin of the \nplanets; in studies of double stars; in observat ions of accretion disks 511 \naround stars; and in some preliminary investigations of gravitational \nperturbations of nearby stars. Many, perhaps  512 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \n \neven most, stars may have planets. We take the fraction of stars that \nhave planets, f p, as roughly equal to \u00b9/ 3. Then the total number of \nplanetary systems in the Galaxy would be N *fp ~ 1.3 \u00d7  1011 (the symbol \n~ means \u201capproximately equal to\u201d). If each system were to have about \nten planets, as ours does, the total number of worlds in the Galaxy \nwould be more than a trillion, a vast arena for the cosmic drama.  \nIn our own solar system there are several bodies that may be suitable \nfor life of some sort: the Earth certainly, and perhaps Mars, Titan and \nJupiter. Once life originates, it tends to be very adaptable and \ntenacious. There must be many different environme nts suitable for \nlife in a given planetary system. But conserva-  \ntively we choose n e = 2. Then the number of planets in the Galaxy \nsuitable for life becomes N *fpne ~ 3 \u00d7 1011. \nExperiments show that under the most common cosmic conditions \nthe molecular basis of life is readily made, the building blocks of \nmolecules able to make copies of themselves. We are now on less \ncertain ground; there may, for example, be impediments in the \nevolution of the genetic code, although I think this unlikely over \nbillions of years of primeval chemistry. We choose f l ~ \u00b9/3 implying a \ntotal number of planets in the Milky Way on which life has arisen at \nleast once as N *fpnefl ~ 1 \u00d7 1011, a hundred bill ion inhabited worlds. \nThat in itself is a remarkable  \nconclusion. But we are not yet finished.  \nThe choices of f i and f c are more difficult. On the one hand, many \nindividually unlikely steps had to occur in biological evolution and \nhuman history for our present intelligence and technology to develop. \nOn the other hand, there must be many quite different pathways to \nan advan ced civilization of specified capabilities. Considering the \napparent difficulty in the evolution of large organisms represented by \nthe Cambrian explosion, let us choose f i \u00d7 fc = \u00b9/ 100, meaning that only \n1 percent of planets on whic h life arises eventually produce a technical \ncivilization. This estimate represents some middle ground among the \nvarying scientific opinions. Some think that the equivalent of the step \nfrom the emergence of trilobites to the domestication of fire goes like  \na shot in all planetary systems; others think that, even given ten or \nfifteen billion years, the evolution of technical  \nEncyclopaedia Galactica \u2014  \n513 \n \n \ncivilizations is unlikely. This is not a subject on which we can do much \nexperimentation as long as our investigations are limited to a single \nplanet. Multiplying these factors together, we find N *fpneflfifc ~ 1 \u00d7 109, \na billion planets on which technical civilizations have arisen at least \nonce. But that is very different from  \nsaying that there are a billion planets on which technical civilizations now \nexist. For this, we must also estimate f L. \nWhat percentage of the lifetime of a planet is marked by a technical \ncivilization? The Earth has harbored a technical civilization \ncharacterized by radio astronomy for only a few decades out of a \nlifetime of a few billion years. So far, then, for our plane t fL is less than \n\u00b9/108, a millionth of a percent. And it is hardly out of the question that \nwe might destroy ourselves tomorrow. Suppose this were to be a \ntypical case, and the destruction so complete that no other technical \ncivilization \u2014of the human or a ny other species \u2014were able to emerge \nin the five or so billion years remaining before the Sun dies. Then N \n= N *fpneflfifcfL ~ 10, and at any given time there would be only a tiny \nsmattering, a handful, a pitiful few technical civilizations in the \nGalaxy, the steady state number maintained as emerging societies \nreplace those recently self -immolated. The number N might even be \nas small as 1. If civilizations tend to destroy themselves soon after \nreaching a technological phase, there might be no one for us to talk \nwith but ourselves. And that we do but poorly. Civilizations would \ntake billions of years of tortuous evolution to arise, and  \nthen snuff themselves out in an instant of unforgivable neglect.  \nBut consider the alternative, the prospect that at least some \ncivilizations learn to live with high technology; that the contradictions \nposed by the vagaries of past brain evolution are consciously resolved \nand do not lead to self -destruction; or that, eve n if major disturbances \ndo occur, they are reversed in the subsequent billions of years of \nbiological evolution. Such societies might live to a prosperous old age, \ntheir lifetimes measured perhaps on geological or stellar evolutionary \ntime scales. If 1 per cent of civilizations can survive technological \nadolescence, take the proper fork at this critical historical branch \npoint and achieve maturity, then f L ~ \u00b9/100, N ~ 107, and the number \nof extant civilizations in the Galaxy is in the millions. Thus, for all  \n514 \u2014 Cosmos  \nour concern about the possible unreliability of our estimates of the \nearly factors in the Drake equation, which involve astronomy, organic \nchemistry and evolutionary biology, the principal uncertainty comes \ndown to economics and politics and what, on Earth , we call human \nnature. It seems fairly clear that if self - destruction is not the \noverwhelmingly preponderant fate of galactic civilizations, then the \nsky is softly humming with messages from the stars.  \nThese estimates are stirring. They suggest that the receipt of a \nmessage from space is, even before we decode it, a profoundly hopeful \nsign. It means that someone has learned to live with high  \ntechnology; that it is possible to survive technological adolescence. \nThis alone, quite apart from the contents of the message, provides a \npowerful justification for the search for other civilizations.  \nIf there are millions of civilizations distributed more or less \nrandomly through the Galaxy, the distance to the nearest is about two \nhundred light -years. Even at the speed of light it would take two \ncenturies for a radio message to get from there to here.  If we had \ninitiated the dialogue, it would be as if the question had been asked \nby Johannes Kepler and the answer received by us. Especially because \nwe, new to radio astronomy, must be comparatively backward, and the \ntransmitting civilization advanced, it  makes more sense for us to listen \nthan to send. For a more advanced civilization, the positions are, of \ncourse, reversed.  \nWe are at the earliest stages of our radio search for other \ncivilizations in space. In an optical photograph of a dense star field, \nthere are hundreds of thousands of stars. By our more optimistic \nestimates, one of them is the site of an advanced civilizat ion. But \nwhich one? Toward which stars should we point our radio telescopes? \nOf the millions of stars that may mark the location of advanced \ncivilizations, we have so far examined by radio no more than \nthousands. We have made about one -tenth of one percent  of the \nrequired effort. But a serious, rigorous, systematic search will come \nsoon. The preparatory steps are now underway, both in the United \nStates and in the Soviet Union. It is comparatively inexpensive: the \ncost of a single naval vessel of intermediat e size \u2014a modern destroyer, \nsay\u2014would pay for a decade -long program in the search for \nextraterrestrial intelligence.  \nBenevolent encounters have not been the rule in human history, \nwhere transcultural contacts have been direct and physical, quite \ndifferent from the receipt of a radio signal, a contact as light as a kiss. \nStill, it is instructive to examine one or two case s from our past, if only \nto calibrate our expectations: Between the times of the American and \nthe French Revolutions, Louis XVI of France outfitted an expedition \nto the Pacific Ocean, a voyage with scientific, geographic, economic 515 \u2014 Cosmos  \nand nationalistic objectives. The commander was the Count of La \nP\u00e9rouse, a noted explorer  516 \nEncyclopaedia Galactica \u2014  \nwho had fought for the United States in its War of Indepen-  \ndence. In July 1786, almost a year after setting sail, he reached the \ncoast of Alaska, a place now called Lituya Bay. He was delighted with \nthe harbor and wrote: \u201cNot a port in the universe could afford more \nconveniences.\u201d In this exemplary location, La  \nP\u00e9rouse perceived some savages, who made signs of friendship, by \ndisplaying and waving white mantles, and different skins. \nSeveral of the canoes of these Indians were fishing in the  \nBay. . . . [We were] continually surrounded by the canoes of the \nsavages, who offered us fish, skins of otters and other animals, \nand different little articles of their dress in exchange for our \niron. To our great surprise, they appeared well accustomed to  \ntraffic, and bargained with us with as much skill as any \ntradesman of Europe.  \nThe Native Americans drove increasingly harder bargains. To  \nLa P\u00e9rouse\u2019s annoyance, they also resorted to pilferage, largely of iron \nobjects, but once of the uniforms of French naval officers hidden \nunder their pillows as they were sleeping one night sur - \nrounded by armed guards \u2014a feat worthy of Harry Houdini. La P\u00e9rouse \nfollowed his royal orders to behave peaceably but complained that the \nnatives \u201cbelieved our forbearance inexhaustible.\u201d He was disdainful of \ntheir society. But no serious damage was done by  either culture to the \nother. After reprovisioning his two ships La P\u00e9rouse sailed out of \nLituya Bay, never to return. The expedition was lost in the South \nPacific in 1788; La P\u00e9rouse and all but one of the members of his crew \nperished.*  \nExactly a century later Cowee, a chief of the Tlingit, related to the \nCanadian anthropologist G. T. Emmons a story of the first meeting \nof his ancestors with the white man, a narrative handed down by word \nof mouth only. The Tlingit possessed no written rec ords, nor had \nCowee ever heard of La P\u00e9rouse. This is a paraphrase of Cowee\u2019s story:  \nLate one spring a large party of Tlingit ventured North to \nYakutat to trade for copper. Iron was even more precious, but it \nwas unobtainable. In entering Lituya Bay four canoes were \nswallowed by the waves. As the survivors made camp and \nmourned for their l ost companions two strange objects entered \nthe Bay. No one knew what they were. They seemed to be great \nblack birds with immense white wings.  \nThe Tlingit believed the world had been created by a great  \n \n517 \n* When La P\u00e9rouse was mustering the ship\u2019s company in France, there \nwere many bright and eager young men who applied but were turned \ndown. One of them was a Corsican artillery officer named Napoleon \nBonaparte. It was an interesting branch point in the hist ory of the world. \nIf La P\u00e9rouse had accepted Bonaparte, the Rosetta stone might never have \nbeen found, Champollion might never have decrypted Egyptian \nhieroglyphics, and in many more important respects our recent history \nmight have been changed significant ly.  \n304 \u2014 Cosmos  \nThe Tlingit inhabitants of Port Frangais  \n(now Lituya Bay, Alaska), where Jean \nFran\u00e7ois de Galaup, Comte de La P\u00e9rouse \n(1741 \u2014c.1788), landed in 1786.

To \nlook upon the Raven was to be turned to \nstone. In their fright, the Tlingit fled \ninto the forest and hid.  But after a while, \nfinding that no harm had come to them, \na few more enterprising souls crept out \nand rolled leaves of the skunk cabbage \ninto crude telescopes, believing that this \nwould prevent being turned to stone. \nThrough the skunk cabbage, it seemed \nthat the great birds were folding their \nwings and that flocks of small black \nmessengers arose from their bodies and \ncrawled upon their feathers.  Now one nearly blind old warrior gathered the people \ntogether and announced that his life was far behind him; for the \ncommon good he would determine whether the Raven would \nturn his children into stone. Putting on his robe of sea otter fur, \nhe entered his canoe and was paddled seaward to the Raven. He \nclimbe d upon it and heard strange voices. With his impaired \nvision he could barely make out the many black forms moving \nbefore him. Perhaps they were crows. When he returned safely \nto his people they crowded a bout him, surprised to see him alive. \nThey touched him and smelled him to see if it was really he. \nAfter much thought the old man convinced himself that it was \nnot the god -raven that he had visited, but rather a giant canoe \nmade by men. The black figures w ere not crows but people of a \ndifferent sort. He convinced the Tlingit, who then visited the \nships and exchanged their furs for many strange articles, chiefly \niron.  \nThe Tlingit had preserved in oral tradition an entirely \nrecognizable and accurate account of their first, almost fully \npeaceable  \n519 \nEncyclopaedia Galactica \u2014  \nAztec view of the conquest of Mexico, \nsixteenth century.

In the early \nsixteenth century a high civilization flourished in central Mexico. The \nAztecs had monumental architecture, elaborate record -keeping, \nexquisite art and an astronomical calendar superior to that of any in \nEurope. Upon viewing the  Aztec artifacts returned by the first \nMexican treasure ships, the artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer wrote in August \n1520: \u201cI have never seen anything heretofore that has so rejoiced my \nheart. I have seen . . . a sun entirely of gold a whole fathom broad [in \nfact, the  Aztec astronomical calendar]; likewise a moon entirely  \nof silver, equally large . . . also two chambers full of all sorts of \nweapons, armor, and other wonderous arms, all of which is fairer to \nsee than marvels.\u201d Intellectuals were stunned at the Aztec books, \n\u201cwhich,\u201d one of them said, \u201calmost resemble those of  the Egyptians.\u201d \nHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s described their capital Tenochtitl\u00e1n as  \n\u201cone of the most beautiful cities in the world . . .

If the Earth had been visited hundreds \nor thousands of years ago by an adva nced extraterrestrial civilization, even \nif the contacted culture was preliterate, we might well expect to have some \nrecognizable form of the encounter preserved. But there is not a single \ncase in which a legend reliably dated from earlier  \npretechnological times can be understood only in terms of contact with an \nextraterrestrial civilization.   \n306 \u2014 Cosmos  \nThe Sun watches impassively as the con - \nquistadores and their Mexican allies \u2014one  \nin the ceremonial headdress of a water bird \u2014\nslaughter the poorly armed and disheartened \nAztecs.

Considering that these people are \nbarbarous, lacking knowledge of God and communication with other \ncivilized nations, it is remarkable to see all that the y have.\u201d Two years \nafter writing these words, Cortes utterly destroyed Tenochtitl\u00e1n along \nwith the rest of the Aztec civilization. Here is an Aztec account:  \nMoctezuma [the Aztec Emperor] was shocked, terrified by what \nhe heard. He was much puzzled by their food, but what made \nhim almost faint away was the telling of how the great Lombard \ngun, at the Spaniards\u2019 command, expelled the shot which \nthundered as it w ent off. The noise weakened one, dizzied one. \nSomething like a stone came out of it in a shower of fire and \nsparks. The smoke was foul; it had a sickening, fetid smell. And \nthe shot, which struck a mountain, knocked it to bits \u2014dissolved \nit. It reduced a tr ee to sawdust \u2014the tree disappeared as if they \nhad blown it away . . . When Moctezuma was told all this, he \nwas ter - ror-struck. He felt faint. His heart failed him.  \nReports continued to arrive: \u201cWe are not as strong as they,\u201d  \nMoctezuma was told. \u201cWe are nothing compared to them.\u201d The \nSpaniards began to be called \u201cthe Gods come from the Heavens.\u201d \n \nNevertheless, the Aztecs had no illusions about the Spaniards, whom \nthey described in these words:  \nThey seized upon the gold as if they were monkeys, their faces \ngleaming. For clearly their thirst for gold was insatiable; they \nstarved for it; they lusted for it; they wanted to stuff themselves \nwith it as if they were pigs. So they went about fingering, taking \nup the streamers of gold, moving   Encyclopaedia Galactica  523 \n \u2014  \nthem back and forth, grabbing them to themselves, babbling, \ntalking gibberish among themselves.  \nBut their insight into the Spanish character did not help them defend \nthemselves. In 1517 a great comet had been seen in  \nMexico. Moctezuma, captured by the legend of the return of the  \nAztec god Quetzalcoatl as a white -skinned man arriving across the \nEastern sea, promptly executed his astrologers. They had not predicted \nthe comet, and they had not explained it. Certain of forthcoming \ndisaster, Moctezuma became distant and gloomy. Aided b y the \nsuperstition of the Aztecs and their own superior technology, an \narmed party of 400 Europeans and their native allies in the year 1521 \nentirely vanquished and utterly destroyed a high civilization of a \nmillion people. The Aztecs had never seen a hors e; there were none \nin the New World. They had not applied iron metallurgy to warfare. \nThey had not invented firearms. Yet the technological gap between \nthem and the Spaniards was not very great, perhaps a few centuries.  \nWe must be the most backward technical society in the Galaxy. Any \nsociety still more backward would not have radio astronomy at all. If \nthe doleful experience of cultural conflict on Earth were the galactic \nstandard, it seems we would already have been des troyed, perhaps \nwith some passing admiration expressed for Shakespeare, Bach and \nVermeer. But this has not happened. Perhaps alien intentions are \nuncompromisingly benign, more like La P\u00e9rouse than Cortes. Or \nmight it be, despite all the pretensions about U FOs and ancient \nastronauts, that our civilization has not yet been discovered?  \nOn the one hand, we have argued that if even a small fraction of \ntechnical civilizations learn to live with themselves and with weapons \nof mass destruction, there should now be an enormous  \nnumber of advanced civilizations in the Galaxy. We already have slow \ninterstellar flight, and think fast interstellar flight a possible goal for \nthe human species. On the other hand, we maintain that there is no \ncredible evidence for the Earth being visite d, now or ever. Is this not \na contradiction? If the nearest civilization is, say, 200 light -years away, \nit takes only 200 years to get from there to here at close to the speed \nof light. Even at 1 percent or a tenth of a percent of the speed of light, \nbeing s from nearby civilizations could have come during the tenure of \nhumanity on Earth. Why are they not here? There are many possi-  \nble answers. Although it runs contrary to the heritage of Aristarchus \nand Copernicus, perhaps we are the first. Some technical civilization \nmust be the first to emerge in the history of the Galaxy. Perhaps we \nare mistaken in our belief that at least occasi onal civilizations avoid  Encyclopaedia Galactica  524 \nself-destruction. Perhaps there is some unforeseen problem to \ninterstellar spaceflight \u2014although, at speeds much less than the velocity \nof light it is difficult to see what such an impediment might be.

We can imagine them, \ncurious and dispassionate, observing us, \nas we would watch a bacterial culture in \na dish of agar, to determine whether, this \nyear again, we manage to avoid self -\ndestruction.  \nBut there is another explanation that \nis consistent with everything we know. If \na great many years ago an advanced \ninterstellar spacefaring civilization \nemerged 200 light -years away, it would \nhave no reason to think there was \nsomething special about the Ea rth unless \nit had been here already. No artifact of \nhuman technology, not even our radio \ntransmissions, has had time, even \ntraveling at the speed of light, to go 200 \nlight-years. From their point of view, all \nnearby star systems are more or less \nequally at tractive for exploration or \ncolonization.*  An emerging technical civilization, after exploring its home \nplanetary system and developing interstellar spaceflight, would slowly \nand tentatively begin exploring the nearby stars. Some stars would \nhave no suitable planets \u2014perhaps they would all be giant gas worlds, \nor tiny asteroids. Others would carry an entourage of suitable planets, \nbut some would be already inhabited, or the atmosphere would be \npoisonous or the climate uncomfortable. In many cases the colonists \nmight have to change \u2014or as we would paro chially say, terraform \u2014a \nworld to make it adequately clement. The re -engineering of a planet \nwill take time. Occasionally, an already suitable world would be found \nand colonized. The utilization of planetary resources so that new \ninterstellar spacecraft co uld be constructed locally would be a slow \nprocess. Eventually a second -generation mission of exploration and \ncolonization would take off toward stars where no one had yet been. \nAnd in this way a civilization might slowly wend its way like a vine \namong the  worlds.  \nIt is possible that at some later time with third and higher orders of \ncolonies developing new worlds, another independent expanding \ncivilization would be discovered. Very likely mutual contact would \nalready have been made by radio or other remote means. T he new \narrivals might be a different sort of colonial society. Conceivably two \nexpanding civilizations with different planetary requirements would \nignore each other, their filigree patterns of expansion intertwining, \nbut not conflicting. They might coopera te in the exploration of a \nprovince of the Galaxy. Even nearby civilizations could spend millions \nof years in such  \n \n* There may be many motivations to go to the stars. If our Sun or a nearby \nstar were about to go supernova, a major program of interstellar  \nspaceflight might suddenly become attractive. If we were very advanced, \nthe discovery that the galactic core was imminently to explode might even \ngenerate serious interest in transgalactic or intergalactic spaceflight. Such \ncosmic violence occurs sufficien tly often that nomadic spacefaring \ncivilizations may not be uncommon. Even so, their arrival here remains \nunlikely.  \n Encyclopaedia Galactica  526 \n \u2014   Encyclopaedia Galactica  527 \n \n Encyclopaedia Galactica  528 \nA great star cloud in the constellation Sagittarius, looking towards the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.

No civilization can possibly survive to an interstellar spacefaring \nphase unless it limits its numbers. Any society with a marked \npopulation explosion will be forced to devote all its energies and \ntechnological skills to feeding and caring for the populati on on its \nhome planet. This is a very powerful conclusion and is in no way based \non the idiosyncrasies of a particular civilization. On any planet, no \nmatter what its biology or social system, an exponential increase in \npopulation will swallow every resour ce. Conversely, any civilization \nthat engages in serious interstellar exploration and colonization must \nhave exercised zero population growth or something very close to it for \nmany generations. But a civilization with a low population growth rate \nwill take  a long time to colonize many worlds, even if the strictures on \nrapid population growth are eased after reaching some lush Eden.  \nMy colleague William Newman and I have calculated that if a \nmillion years ago a spacefaring civilization with a low population \ngrowth rate emerged two hundred light -years away and spread \noutward, colonizing suitable worlds along the way, their survey \nstarships would be entering our solar system only about now. But a \nmillion years is a very long period of time. If the nearest civilization is \nyounger than this, they would not have reached us yet. A sphere two \nhundred light -years in radius contains 200,000 sun s and perhaps a \ncomparable number of worlds suitable for colonization. It is only after \n200,000 other worlds have been colonized that, in the usual course of \nthings, our solar system would be accidentally discovered to harbor an \nindigenous civilization.  \nWhat does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old?  \nWe have had radio telescopes and spaceships for a few decades; our \ntechnical civilization is a few hundred years old, scientific ideas of a \nmodern cast a few thousand, civilization in general a few tens of \nthousands of years; human beings evolved on this p lanet only a few \nmillion years ago. At anything like our present rate of technical \nprogress, an advanced civilization millions of years old is as much \nbeyond us as we are beyond a bush baby or a macaque. Would we even \nrecognize its presence? Would a societ y a million years in advance of \nus be interested in colonization or interstellar spaceflight? People have \na finite lifespan for a reason. Enormous progress in the biological and \nmedical sciences might uncover that reason and lead to suitable \nremedies. Coul d it  \nbe that we are so interested in spaceflight because it is a way of \nperpetuating ourselves beyond our own lifetimes? Might a civilization \ncomposed of essentially immortal beings consider interstellar \nexploration fundamentally childish? It may be that we hav e not been \nvisited because the stars are strewn abundantly in the expanse of space, \nso that before a nearby civilization arrives,  \nEncyclopaedia Galactica  \nit has altered its exploratory motivations or evolved into forms \nindetectable to us.  \nA standard motif in science fiction and UFO literature assumes \nextraterrestrials roughly as capable as we. Perhaps they have a different \nsort of spaceship or ray gun, but in battle \u2014and science fiction loves to \nportray battles between civilizations \u2014they and  we are rather evenly \nmatched. In fact, there is almost no chance that two galactic \ncivilizations will interact at the same level. In any confrontation, one \nwill always utterly dominate the other. A million years is a great many. \nIf an advanced civilizatio n were to arrive in our solar system, there \nwould be nothing whatever we could do about it. Their science and \ntechnology would be far beyond ours. It is pointless to worry about \nthe possible malevolent intentions of an advanced civilization with \nwhom we mi ght make contact. It is more likely that the mere fact they \nhave survived so long means they have learned to live with themselves \nand others. Perhaps our fears about extraterrestrial contact are merely \na projection of our own backwardness, an expression of  our guilty \nconscience about our past history: the ravages that have been visited \non civilizations only slightly more backward than we. We remember \nColumbus and the Arawaks, Cort\u00e9s and the Aztecs, even the fate of \nthe Tlingit in the generations after La P\u00e9 rouse. We remember and we \nworry. But if an interstellar armada appears in our skies, I predict we \nwill be very accommodating.  \nA very different kind of contact is much more likely \u2014the case we \nhave already discussed in which we receive a rich, complex message, \nprobably by radio, from another civilization in space, but do not make, \nat least for a while, physical contact with them. I n this case there is no \nway for the transmitting civilization to know whether we have received \nthe message. If we find the contents offensive or frightening, we are \nnot obliged to reply. But if the message contains valuable information, \nthe consequences fo r our own civilization will be stunning \u2014insights \non alien science and technology, art, music, politics, ethics, \nphilosophy and religion, and most of all, a profound \ndeprovincialization of the human condition. We will know what else \nis possible.  \nBecause we will share scientific and mathematical insights with any \nother civilization, I believe that understanding the interstellar message \nwill be the easiest part of the problem.

By Jon Lomberg \nand the author.  \ncategories: one in which the scientists are \nunable to convince nonscientists to \nauthorize a search for extraplanetary intelligence, in which energies are directed exclusively inward, in \nwhich conventional perceptions remain unchallenged and society \nfalters and retreats from the stars; and another category in which the \ngrand vision of contact with other civilizations is sh ared widely, and a \nmajor search is undertaken.  \nThis is one of the few human endeavors where even a failure is a \nsuccess. If we were to carry out a rigorous search for extraterrestrial \nradio signals encompassing millions of stars and heard nothing, we \nwould conclude that galactic civilizations were at b est extremely rare, \na calibration of our place in the universe. It would speak eloquently of \nhow rare are the living things of our planet, and would underscore, as \nnothing else in human history has, the individual worth of every \nhuman being. If we were to succeed, the history of our species and our \nplanet would be changed forever.  \nIt would be easy for extraterrestrials to make an unambiguously \nartificial interstellar message. For example, the first ten prime \nnumbers \u2014numbers divisible only by themselves and by one \u2014are 1, 2, \n3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. It is extremely unlikely that a ny natural \nphysical process could transmit radio messages containing prime \nnumbers only. If we received such a message we would deduce a \ncivilization out there that was at least fond of prime numbers. But the \nmost likely case is that interstellar communica tion will be a kind of \npalimpsest, like the palimpsests of ancient writers short of papyrus or \nstone who superimposed their messages on top of preexisting \nmessages. Perhaps at an adjacent frequency or a faster timing, there \nwould be another message, which would turn out to be a primer, an \nintroduction to the language of interstellar discourse. The primer \nwould be repeated again and again because the transmitting \ncivilization would have no way to know when we tuned in on the \nmessage. And then, deeper in the palimpsest, underneath the \nannouncement signal and the primer, would be the real message. \nRadio technology permits that message to be inconceivably rich. \nPerhaps when we tuned in, we would find ourselves in the midst of \nVolume 3,267 of the Encyclopaedia Galactica . \nWe would discover the nature of other civilizations. There would \nbe many of them, each composed of organisms astonishingly different \nfrom anything on this planet. They would view the universe somewhat \ndifferently. They would have different arts and social functions. They \nwould be interested in things we never thought of. By comparing our \nknowledge with theirs, we would grow immeasurably. And with our \nnewly acquired information sorted into a computer memory, we \nwould be able to see which sort of civilization  lived where in the \nGalaxy. Imagine a huge galactic computer, a repository, more or less \nup-to-date, of information on the nature and activities of all the \ncivilizations in   \nEncyclopaedia Galactica \u2014 315 \nthe Milky Way Galaxy, a great library of life in the Cosmos. Perhaps \namong the contents of the Encyclopaedia Galactica  will be a set of \nsummaries of such civilizations, the information enigmatic, \ntantalizing, evocative \u2014even after we succeed in translating it.  \nEventually, taking as much time as we wished, we would decide to \nreply. We would transmit some information about ourselves \u2014just the \nbasics at first \u2014as the start of a long interstellar dialogue which we \nwould begin but which, because of the vast distances o f interstellar \nspace and the finite velocity of light, would be continued by our \nremote descendants. And someday, on a planet of some far distant \nstar, a being very different from any of us would request a printout \nfrom the latest edition of the Encyclopae dia Galactica  and acquire a \nlittle information about the newest society to join the community of \ngalactic civilizations.   \n \n \nAn emissary from Earth: Apollo 14 poised before its night launch to the Moon.

A very fit consideration, and matter of \nReflection, for those Kings and Princes who sacrifice the Lives of so many People, \nonly to fl atter their Ambition in being Masters of some pitiful corner of this small \nSpot.  \n\u2014Christiaan Huygens, New Conjectures Concerning the Planetary Worlds,  Their \nInhabitants and Productions , c. 1690  \n\u201cTo the entire world,\u201d added our Father the Sun, \u201cI give my light and my radiance; \nI give men warmth when they are cold; I cause their fields to fructify and their \ncattle to multiply; each day that passes I go around the world to secure a better \nknowledge of men\u2019s needs and to satisfy those needs. Follow my example .\u201d \n\u2014An Inca myth recorded in \u201cThe Royal Commentaries\u201d of Garcilaso de la Vega, \n1556  \nWe look back through countless millions of years and see the great will to live \nstruggling out of the intertidal slime, struggling from shape to shape and from \npower to power, crawling and then walking confidently upon the land, struggling \ngeneration after  generation to master the air, creeping down into the darkness of \nthe deep; we see it turn upon itself in rage and hunger and reshape itself anew, we \n540 \u2014 Cosmos  \nwatch it draw nearer and more akin to us, expanding, elaborating itself, pursuing \nits relentless inconceivable purpose, until at last it reaches us and its being beats \nthrough our brains and arteries . . . It is possible to believe that all the past is but  \nthe beginning of a beginning, and that all that is and has been is but the twilight \nof the dawn. It is possible to believe that all that the human mind has ever \naccomplished is but the dream before the awakening . . . Out of our . . . lineage, \nminds will spring, that will reach back to us in our littleness to know us better \nthan we know ourselves. A day will come, one day in the unending succession of \ndays, when beings, beings who are now latent in our thoughts and hidden in our \nloins, shall stand upon thi s earth as one stands upon a footstool, and shall laugh \nand reach out their hands amidst the stars.  \n\u2014H. G. Wells, \u201cThe Discovery of the Future,\u201d Nature  65, 326  \n(1902)  \nTHE COSMOS WAS DISCOVERED ONLY YESTERDAY . For a million \nyears it was clear to everyone that there were no other places than the \nEarth. Then in the last tenth of a percent of the lifetime of our species, \nin the instant between Aristarchus and ourselves, we reluctantly \nnoticed that we were not the c enter and purpose of the Universe, but \nrather lived on a tiny and fragile world lost in immensity and eternity, \ndrifting in a great cosmic ocean dotted here and there with a hundred \nbillion galaxies and a billion t rillion stars. We have bravely tested the \nwaters and have found the ocean to our liking, resonant with our \nnature. Something in us recognizes the Cosmos as home. We are \nmade of stellar ash. Our origin and evolution have been tied to distant \ncosmic events. The exploration of the Cosmos is a voyage of self -\ndiscovery.  \nAs the ancient mythmakers knew, we are the children equally of \nthe sky and the Earth. In our tenure on this planet we have \naccumulated dangerous evolutionary baggage, hereditary propensities \nfor aggression and ritual, submission to leaders and hostility to  \noutsiders, which place our survival in some question. But we have also \nacquired compassion for others, love for our children and our \nchildren\u2019s children, a desire to learn from history, and a great soaring \npassionate intelligence \u2014the clear tools for our c ontinued survival and \nprosperity. Which aspects of our nature will prevail is uncertain, \nparticularly when our vision and understanding and prospects are \nbound exclusively to the Earth \u2014or, worse, to one small part of it. But \nup there in the immensity of th e Cosmos, an inescapable perspective \nawaits us. There are not yet any obvious signs of extraterrestrial \nintelligence and this makes us wonder whether civilizations like ours \nalways rush implacably, headlong, toward self -destruction. National \nboundaries are  not evident when we view the Earth from space. \nFanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little \ndifficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent \nfading to become an inconspicuous point of light against the bastion \nand citadel of the stars. Travel is broadening.  541 \nWho Speaks for Earth? \u2014  542 \n \n543 \nThe Great Chain of Being. Between atoms and snowflakes on the scale of the very small, and suns and galaxies on the \nscale of the very large, humans are growing to consciousness of our place in the Cosmos. Painting by Jon Lomberg.  544 \u2014 Cosmos  \nThere are worlds on which life has never arisen. There are worlds \nthat have been charred and ruined by cosmic catastrophes. We are \nfortunate: we are alive; we are powerful; the welfare of our civilization \nand our species is in our hands. If we do not speak  for Earth, who will? \nIf we are not committed to our own survival, who will be?  \nThe human species is now undertaking a great venture that if \nsuccessful will be as important as the colonization of the land or the \ndescent from the trees. We are haltingly, tentatively breaking the \nshackles of Earth \u2014metaphorically, in confronting and tami ng the \nadmonitions of those more primitive brains within us; physically, in \nvoyaging to the planets and listening for the messages from the stars. \nThese two enterprises are linked indissolubly. Each, I believe, is a \nnecessary condition for the other. But o ur energies are directed far \nmore toward war. Hypnotized by mutual mistrust, almost never \nconcerned for the species or the planet, the nations prepare for death. \nAnd because what we are doing is so horrifying, we tend not to think \nof it much. But what we d o not consider we are unlikely to put right.  \nEvery thinking person fears nuclear war, and every technological \nstate plans for it. Everyone knows it is madness, and every nation has \nan excuse. There is a dreary chain of causality: The  \nGermans were working on the bomb at the beginning of World War \nII; so the Americans had to make one first. If the Americans had one, \nthe Soviets had to have one, and then the British, the French, the \nChinese, the Indians, the Pakistanis . . . By the end of  the twentieth \ncentury many nations had collected nuclear weapons. They were easy \nto devise. Fissionable material could be stolen from nuclear reactors. \nNuclear weapons became almost a home handicraft industry.  \nThe conventional bombs of World War II were called blockbusters. \nFilled with twenty tons of TNT, they could destroy a city block. All \nthe bombs dropped on all the cities in World War II amounted to \nsome two million tons, two megatons, of TNT \u2014 Coventry and \nRotterdam, Dresden and Tokyo, all the death that rained from the \nskies between 1939 and 1945: a hundred thousand blockbusters, two \nmegatons. By the late twentieth century, two megatons was the energy \nreleased in the explosion of a single more or less humdr um \nthermonuclear bomb: one bomb with the  \ndestructive force of the Second World War. But there are tens of \nthousands of nuclear weapons. By the ninth decade of the twentieth \ncentury the strategic missile and bomber forces of the Soviet Union \nand the United States were aiming warheads at over  \n15,000 designated targets. No place on the planet was safe. The energy \ncontained in these weapons, genies of death patiently awaiting the \nrubbing of the lamps, was far more than 10,000 megatons \u2014but with 545 \u2014 Cosmos  \nthe destruction concentrated efficiently, not over six years but over a \nfew hours, a blockbuster for every  546 \nWho Speaks for Earth ? \n\u2014  \nfamily on the planet, a World War II every second for the length of a \nlazy afternoon.  \nThe immediate causes of death from nuclear attack are the blast \nwave, which can flatten heavily reinforced buildings many kilometers \naway, the firestorm, the gamma rays and the neutrons, which \neffectively fry the insides of passersby. A school girl who sur vived the \nAmerican nuclear attack on Hiroshima, the event that ended the \nSecond World War, wrote this first -hand account:  \nThrough a darkness like the bottom of hell, I could hear the \nvoices of the other students calling for their mothers. And at the \nbase of the bridge, inside a big cistern that had been dug out \nthere, was a mother weeping, holding above her head a naked \nbaby that was burned bright red all over its body. And another \nmother was crying and sobbing as she gave her burned breast to \nher baby. In the cistern the students stood with only their heads \nabove the water, and their two hands, which they clasped as they \nimploringly cried and screamed, calling for their parents. But \nevery single person who passed was wounded, all of them, and \nthere was no one, there was no one to turn to for help. And the \nsinged hair on the heads of the people was frizzled and whitish and covered with dust. They did \nnot appear to be human, not \ncreatures of this world.  \nThe Hiroshima explosion, unlike the \nsubsequent Nagasaki explosion, was an \nair burst high above the surface, so the \nfallout was insignificant. But on March \n1, 1954, a thermonuclear weapons test at \nBikini in the Marshall Islands detonated \nat higher yield  \nFallout in a nuclear war. Of the 15,000 \ntargets in a full nuclear exchange, these \nTitan and Minuteman intercontinental \nballistic missile sites in the American \nMidwest are likely targets for surface bursts \nby a pair of one -megaton thermonuclear \nweapons. The  energy released by these two \nexplosions alone would equal all the \ndestruction caused all over the world by all \nthe aircraft in World War II. The cloud of \nradioactive debris would be blown by \nprevailing winds towards the East Coast of \n547 \nthe United States, the same path followed by the Mount St. Helens \nvolcanic debris after its eruptions in 1980. The outer contour curve shows \nthe area within which casualties would exceed 50 percent from \nradioactive fallout alone. Comparable horrors would b e visited on the \nSoviet Union by two one -megaton bursts on, say, the Western Ukraine. \nCourtesy Scientific American.  From Limited Nuclear War  by Sidney D.

A great radioactive cloud was deposited on the tiny \natoll of Rongalap, 150 kilometers away, where the inhabitants likened \nthe explosion to the Sun rising in the West. A few hours later, \nradioactive ash fell on Rongalap like snow. The average  dose received \nwas only about 175 rads, a little less than half the dose needed to kill \nan average person. Being far from the explosion, not many people \ndied. Of course, the radioactive strontium they ate was concentrated \nin their bones, and the radioactiv e iodine was concentrated in their \nthyroids. Two - thirds of the children and one -third of the adults later \ndeveloped thyroid abnormalities, growth retardation or malignant \ntumors. In compensation, the Marshall Islanders received expert \nmedical care.  \nThe yield of the Hiroshima bomb was only thirteen kilotons, the \nequivalent of thirteen thousand tons of TNT. The Bikini test yield was \nfifteen megatons. In a full nuclear exchange, in the paroxysm of \nthermonuclear war, the equivalent of a million Hiroshima  bombs \nwould be dropped all over the world. At the  \nHiroshima death rate of some hundred thousand people killed per \nequivalent thirteen -kiloton weapon, this would be enough to kill a \nhundred billion people. But there were less than five billion people on \nthe planet in the late twentieth century. Of course, in such an \nexchange, not everyone would be killed by the blast and the firestorm, \nthe radiation and the fallout \u2014although fallout does last for a longish \ntime: 90 percent of the strontium 90 will decay in 96 years; 90 percent \nof the cesium 137, in 100 years; 90 percent of the iodine 131 in only a \nmonth . \nThe survivors would witness more subtle consequences of the war. \nA full nuclear exchange would burn the nitrogen in the upper air, \nconverting it to oxides of nitrogen, which would in turn destroy a \nsignificant amount of the ozone in the high atmosphere, ad mitting an \nintense dose of solar ultraviolet radiation.* The increased ultraviolet \nflux would last for years. It would produce skin cancer preferentially \nin light -skinned people. Much more important, it would affect the \necology of our planet in an unknown way. Ultraviolet light destroys \ncrops. Many microorganisms would be killed; we do not know which \nones or how many, or what the consequences might be. The organisms \nkilled might, for all we know, be at the base of a vast ecological pyramid \nat the top of whi ch totter we.  \nThe dust put into the air in a full nuclear exchange would reflect \nsunlight and cool the Earth a little. Even a little cooling can have \ndisastrous agricultural consequences. Birds are more easily killed by \nradiation than insects. Plagues of insects and  \n \n549 \u2014 Cosmos  \n* The process is similar to, but much more dangerous than, the \ndestruction of the ozone layer by the fluorocarbon propellants in aerosol \nspray cans, which have accordingly been banned by a number of nations; \nand to that invoked in the explanation of the ex tinction of the dinosaurs \nby a supernova explosion a few dozen light -years away.  550 \nWho Speaks for Earth? \u2014  \nconsequent further agricultural disorders are a likely consequence of \nnuclear war. There is also another kind of plague to worry about: the \nplague bacillus is endemic all over the Earth. In the late twentieth \ncentury humans did not much die of plague \u2014not b ecause it was \nabsent, but because resistance was high. However, the radiation \nproduced in a nuclear war, among its many other effects, debilitates \nthe body\u2019s immunological system, causing a deterioration of our \nability to resist disease. In the longer term , there are mutations, new \nvarieties of microbes and insects, that might cause still further \nproblems for any human survivors of a nuclear holocaust; and perhaps \nafter a while, when there has been enough time for the recessive \nmutations to recombine and be  expressed, new and horrifying \nvarieties of humans. Most of these mutations, when expressed, would \nbe lethal. A few would not. And then there would be other agonies: \nthe loss of loved ones; the legions of the burned, the blind and the \nmutilated; disease, p lague, long -lived radioactive poisons in the air and \nwater; the threat of tumors and stillbirths and malformed children; \nthe absence of medical care; the hopeless sense of a civilization \ndestroyed for nothing; the knowledge that we could have prevented it \nand did not.  \nL. F. Richardson was a British meteorologist interested in war. He \nwished to understand its causes. There are intellectual parallels \nbetween war and weather. Both are complex. Both exhibit regularities, \nimplying that they are not implacable forces but natu ral systems that \ncan be understood and controlled. To understand the global weather \nyou must first collect a great body of meteorological data; you must \ndiscover how the weather actually behaves. Our approach must be the \nsame, Richardson decided, if we are  to understand warfare. So, for the \nyears between 1820 and 1945, he collected data on the hundreds of \nwars that had then been fought on our poor planet.  \nRichardson\u2019s results were published posthumously in a book called \nThe Statistics of Deadly Quarrels . Because he was interested in how long \nyou had to wait for a war that would claim a specified number of \nvictims, he defined an index, M, the magnitude of a war, a measure of \nthe number of immediate deaths it causes. A war of magnitude M = 3 \nmight be merel y a skirmish, killing only a thousand people (l03). M = \n5 or M = 6 denote more serious wars, where a hundred thousand (l05) \nor a million (106) people are killed. World Wars I and II had larger \nmagnitudes. He found that the more people killed in a war, the less \nlikely it was to occur, and the longer before you would witness it, just \nas violent storms occur less frequently than cloudbursts. From his data \nwe can construct a graph (p. 327), which shows how long on the 551 \naverage during the past century and a half you would have to wait to \nwitness a war of magnitude M.  \nRichardson proposed that if you continue the curve to very small values \nof M, all the way to M = 0, it roughly predicts the  552 \u2014 Cosmos  \n \n \nWho Speaks for Earth ? \u2014 325  \n \n \nThe ominous shape of nuclear war: two nuclear explosions.

Individual killings and wars on the \nlargest scale are, he said, two ends of a continuum, an unbroken curve. \nIt follows, not only in a trivial sense but also I bel ieve in a very deep \npsychological sense, that war is murder writ large. When our well -\nbeing is threatened, when our illusions about ourselves are \nchallenged, we tend \u2014some of us at least \u2014to fly into murderous rages. \nAnd when the same provocations are applie d to nation states, they, \ntoo, sometimes fly into murderous rages, egged on often enough by \nthose seeking personal power or profit. But as the technology of \nmurder improves and the penalties of war increase, a great many \npeople must be made to fly into mur derous rages simultaneously for \na major war to be mustered. Because the organs of mass \ncommunication are often in the hands of the state, this can commonly \nbe arranged. (Nuclear war is the exception. It can be triggered by a \nvery small number of people.)  \nWe see here a conflict between our passions and what is sometimes \ncalled our better natures; between the deep, ancient reptilian part of \nthe brain, the R -complex, in charge of murderous rages, and the more \nrecently evolved mammalian and human parts of the brain, the limbic \nsystem and the cerebral cortex. When humans lived in small groups, \nwhen our weapons were comparatively paltry, even an enraged warrior \ncould kill only a few. As our technology improved, the means of war \nalso improved. In the same brief in terval, we also have improved. We \nhave tempered our anger, frustration and despair with reason. We \nhave ameliorated on a planetary scale injustices that only recently were \nglobal and endemic. But our weapons can now kill billions. Have we \nimproved fast enough? Are w e teaching reason as effectively as we can? \nHave we courageously studied the causes of war?  \nWhat is often called the strategy of nuclear deterrence is remarkable \nfor its reliance on the behavior of our nonhuman ancestors. Henry \nKissinger, a contemporary politician, wrote: \u201cDeterrence depends, \nabove all, on psychological criteria. For purposes of deterrence, a bluff \ntaken seriously is more useful than a serious threat interpreted as a \nbluff.\u201d Truly effective nuclear bluffing, however, includes occasional \npostures of irrationality, a distancing from the horrors of nuclear war. \nThen the potential ene my is tempted to submit on points of dispute \nrather than unleash a global confrontation, which the aura of \nirrationality has made plausible. The chief danger of adopting a \ncredible pose of irrationality is that to succeed in the pretense you \nhave to be ver y good. After a while, you get used to it. It becomes \npretense no longer.  557 \u2014 Cosmos  \nThe global balance of terror, pioneered by the United States and \nthe Soviet Union, holds hostage the citizens of the Earth. Each side \ndraws limits on the permissible behavior of the other.   \nWho Speaks for Earth? \u2014 327 \nThe Richardson diagram. The horizontal axis \nshows the magnitude of a war (M = 5  \nmeans 105 people killed; M = 10 means 1010, i.e., \nevery human on the planet). The vertical axis \nshows the time to wait until a war of magnitude \nM erupts. The curve is based on Richardsons data \nfor wars between 1820 and 1945. Simple \nextrapolation suggests that M = 10 will not be \nreached for about a  thousand years (1820 + 1,000 \n= 2820). But the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nhas probably moved the  \ncurve into the shaded area, and the waiting time \nto Doomsday may be ominously short. The shape \nof the Richardson curve is within our control, but \nonly if humans are willing to embrace nuclear \ndisarma-  \nment and restructure dramatically the planetary \ncommunity.  \nThe potential enemy is assured that if the limit is transgressed, nuclear \nwar will follow. However, the definition of the limit changes from time \nto time. Each side must be quite confident that the other understands \nthe new limits. Each side is tempted to increase its military advantage, \nbut not in so striking a way as seriously to alarm the other. Each side \ncontinually explores the limits of the other\u2019s tolerance, as in flights of \nnuclear bombers over the Arctic wastes; the Cuban missile crisis; the \ntestin g of anti -satellite weapons; the Vietnam and Afghanistan wars \u2014\na few entries from a long and dolorous list. The global balance of \nterror is a very delicate balance. It depends on things not going wrong, \non mistakes not being made, on the reptilian passions not being \nseriously aroused.  \nAnd so we return to Richardson. In the diagram the solid line is \nthe waiting time for a war of magnitude M \u2014that is, the average time \nwe would have to wait to witness a war that kills 10M people (where M \nrepresents the number of zeroes after the one in our usual exponential \narithmetic). Also shown, as a vertical bar at the right of the diagram, \nis the world population in recent years, which reached one billion \npeople (M = 9) around 1835 an d is now about 4.5 billion people (M \n= 9.7). When the Richardson curve  crosses the vertical bar we have \nspecified the waiting time to Doomsday: how many years until the \npopulation of the Earth is destroyed in some great war. With \n \nRichardson\u2019s curve and the simplest extrapolation for the future \ngrowth of the human population, the two curves do not intersect until \nthe thirtieth century or so, and Doomsday is deferred.  \nBut World War II was of magnitude 7.7: some fifty million military \npersonnel and noncombatants were killed. The technology  560 \u2014 Cosmos  \nof death advanced ominously. Nuclear weapons were used for the first \ntime. There is little indication that the motivations and propensities \nfor warfare have diminished since, and both conventional and nuclear \nweaponry has become far more deadly. Thus, the top of the \nRichardson curve is shifting downward by an unknown amount. If its \nnew position is somewhere in the shaded region of the figure, we may \nhave only another few decades until Doomsday. A more detailed \ncomparison of the incidence of wars before and after 1945 might help \nto clarify this question. It is of more than passing concern.  \nThis is merely another way of saying what we have known for \ndecades: the development of nuclear weapons and their delivery \nsystems will, sooner or later, lead to global disaster. Many of the \nAmerican and European \u00e9migr\u00e9 scientists who developed the first \nnuclear weapons were profoundly distressed about the demon they \nhad let loose on the world. They pleaded for the global abolition of \nnuclear weapons. But their pleas went unheeded; the prospect of a \nnational strategic advantage galvanized both the U.S.S.R. and the \nUnited States, and the nuclear arms race began.  \nIn the same period, there was a burgeoning international trade in \nthe devastating non -nuclear weapons coyly called \u201cconventional.\u201d In \nthe past twenty -five years, in dollars corrected for inflation, the annual \ninternational arms trade has gone from $300 mil lion to much more \nthan $20 billion. In the years between 1950 and 1968, for which good \nstatistics seem to be available, there were, on the average, worldwide \nseveral accidents involving nuclear weapons per year, although \nperhaps no more than one or two acc idental nuclear explosions. The \nweapons establishments in the Soviet Union, the United States and \nother nations are large and powerful. In the United States they \ninclude major corporations famous for their homey domestic \nmanufactures. According to one esti mate, the corporate profits in \nmilitary weapons procurement are 30 to 50 percent higher than in an \nequally technological but competitive civilian market. Cost overruns \nin military weapons systems are permitted on a scale that would be \nconsidered unacceptab le in the civilian sphere. In the Soviet Union \nthe resources, quality, attention and care given to military production \nis in striking contrast to the little left for consumer goods. According \nto some estimates, almost half the scientists and high technolog ists on \nEarth are employed full - or part -time on military matters. Those \nengaged in the development and manufacture of weapons of mass \ndestruction are given salaries, perquisites of power and, where \npossible, public honors at the highest levels available i n their \nrespective societies. The secrecy of weapons development, carried to \nespecially extravagant lengths in the Soviet Union, implies that 561 \u2014 Cosmos  \nindividuals so employed need almost never accept responsibility for \ntheir actions. They are protected and anonymous. Military secrecy   \nWho Speaks for Earth? \u2014 \n329 \n \nmakes the military the most difficult sector of any society for the \ncitizens to monitor. If we do not know what they do, it is very hard \nfor us to stop them. And with the rewards so substantial, with the \nhostile military establishments beholden to each oth er in some \nghastly mutual embrace, the world discovers itself drifting toward the \nultimate undoing of the human enterprise.  \nEvery major power has some widely publicized justification for its \nprocurement and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction, often \nincluding a reptilian reminder of the presumed character and cultural \ndefects of potential enemies (as opposed to us stout  \nfellows), or of the intentions of others, but never ourselves, to conquer \nthe world. Every nation seems to have its set of forbidden possibilities, \nwhich its citizenry and adherents must not at any cost be permitted to \nthink seriously about. In the Soviet Union these include capitalism, \nGod, and the surrender of national sovereignty; in the United States, \nsocialism, atheism, and the surrender of national sovereignty. It is the \nsame all over the world.  \nHow would we explain the global arms race to a dispassionate \nextraterrestrial observer? How would we justify the most recent \ndestabilizing developments of killer -satellites, particle beam weapons, \nlasers, neutron bombs, cruise missiles, and the proposed co nversion \nof areas the size of modest countries to the enterprise of hiding each \nintercontinental ballistic missile among hundreds of decoys? Would \nwe argue that ten thousand targeted nuclear warheads are likely to \nenhance the prospects for our survival? Wh at account would we give of our stewardship of the planet Earth? \nWe have heard the rationales offered by \nthe nuclear superpowers. We know who \nspeaks for the nations. But who speaks \nfor the human species? Who speaks for \nEarth?  \nThe upper atmosphere of the planet  \nEarth, seen at twilight.

Humans \nhave evolved gregariously. We delight in each other\u2019s company; we care for one another. We cooperate. \nAltruism is built into us. We have brilliantly deciphered some of the \npatterns of Nature. We have sufficient motivation to work together \nand the ability to figure out how to do it. If we are will ing to \ncontemplate nuclear war and the wholesale destruction of our \nemerging global society, should we not also be willing to contemplate \na wholesale restructuring of our societies? From an extraterrestrial \nperspec-  \ntive, our global civilization is clearly on the edge of failure in the most \nimportant task it faces: to preserve the lives and well -being of the \ncitizens of the planet. Should we not then be willing to explore \nvigorously, in every nation, major changes in the traditional ways of \ndoing things, a fundamental redesign of economic, political, social \nand religious institutions?  \nFaced with so disquieting an alternative, we are always tempted to \nminimize the seriousness of the problem, to argue that those who \nworry about doomsdays are alarmists; to hold that fundamental \nchanges in our institutions are impractical or contrary to \u201chu man \nnature,\u201d as if nuclear war were practical, or as if there were only one \nhuman nature. Full -scale nuclear war has never happened. Somehow \nthis is taken to imply that it never will. But we can experience it only \nonce. By then it will be too late to refor mulate the statistics.  \nThe United States is one of the few governments that actually \nsupports an agency devoted to reversing the arms race. But the \ncomparative budgets of the Department of Defense (153 billion \ndollars per year in 1980) and of the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency (0.018 billion dollars per year) remind us of the relative \nimportance we have assigned to the two activities. Would not a \nrational society spend more on understanding and preventing, than \non preparing for, the next war? It is possible to study the caus es of war. \nAt present our understanding is meager \u2014probably because \ndisarmament budgets have, since the time of Sargon of Akkad, been \nsomewhere between ineffective and nonexistent. Microbiologists and \nphysicians study diseases mainly to cure people. Rarely are they rooting \nfor the pathogen. Let us study war as if it were, as Einstein aptly called \nit, an illness of childhood. We have reached the point where \nproliferation of nuclear arms and resistance to nuclear disarmament \nthreaten every person on the planet . There are no more special \ninterests or special cases. Our survival depends on committing our \nintelligence and resources on a massive scale to take charge of our own \ndestiny, to guarantee that Richardson\u2019s curve does not veer to the \nright.  \nWe, the nuclear hostages \u2014all the peoples of the Earth \u2014must \neducate ourselves about conventional and nuclear warfare. Then we \nmust educate our governments. We must learn the science  \n \nWho Speaks for Earth ? \u2014 331 \nand technology that provide the only conceivable tools for our \nsurvival. We must be willing to challenge courageously the \nconventional social, political, economic and religious wisdom. We \nmust make every effort to understand that our fellow humans, all ove r \nthe world, are human. Of course, such steps are difficult. But as \nEinstein many times replied when his suggestions were rejected as \nimpractical or as inconsistent with \u201chuman nature\u201d: What is the \nalternative?  \nMammals characteristically nuzzle, fondle, hug, caress, pet, groom \nand love their young, behavior essentially unknown among the \nreptiles. If it is really true that the R -complex and limbic systems live \nin an uneasy truce within our skulls and still partake  of their ancient \npredelictions, we might expect affectionate parental indulgence to \nencourage our mammalian natures, and the absence of physical \naffection to prod reptilian behavior. There is some evidence that this \nis the case. In laboratory experiments,  Harry and Margaret Harlow \nfound that monkeys raised in cages and physically isolated \u2014even \nthough they could see, hear and smell their simian fellows \u2014developed \na range of morose, withdrawn, self -destructive and otherwise \nabnormal characteristics. In humans  the same is observed for children \nraised without physical affection \u2014usually in institutions \u2014where they \nare clearly in great pain.  \nThe neuropsychologist James W. Prescott has performed a startling \ncross -cultural statistical analysis of 400 preindustrial societies and \nfound that cultures that lavish physical affection on infants tend to be \ndisinclined to violence. Even societies withou t notable fondling of \ninfants develop nonviolent adults, provided sexual activity in \nadolescents is not repressed. Prescott believes that cultures with a \npredisposition for violence are composed of individuals who have \nbeen deprived \u2014during at least one of two  \ncritical stages in life, infancy and adolescence \u2014of the pleasures of the \nbody. Where physical affection is encouraged, theft, organized religion \nand invidious displays of wealth are inconspicuous; where infants are \nphysically punished, there tends to be sl avery, frequent killing, \ntorturing and mutilation of enemies, a devotion to the inferiority of \nwomen, and a belief in one or more supernatural beings who \nintervene in daily life.  \nWe do not understand human behavior well enough to be sure of \nthe mechanisms underlying these relationships, although we can \nconjecture. But the correlations are significant. Prescott writes: \u201cThe \npercent likelihood of a society becoming physically violent  if it is  \nphysically affectionate toward its infants and tolerant of premarital \nsexual behavior is 2 percent. The probability of this relationship \noccurring by chance is 125,000 to one. I am not aware of any other \ndevelopmental variable that has such a high degree of predictive \nvalidity.\u201d Infants hunger for phy sical affection; adolescents are \nstrongly driven to sexual activity. If youngsters   \n332 \u2014 Cosmos  \nhad their way, societies might develop in which adults have little \ntolerance for aggression, territoriality, ritual and social hierarchy \n(although in the course of growing up the children might well \nexperience these reptilian behaviors). If Prescott is rig ht, in an age of \nnuclear weapons and effective contraceptives, child abuse and severe \nsexual repression are crimes against humanity. More work on this \nprovocative thesis is clearly needed. Meanwhile, we can each make a \npersonal and noncontroversial contrib ution to the future of the world \nby hugging our infants tenderly.  \nIf the inclinations toward slavery and racism, misogyny and \nviolence are connected \u2014as individual character and human history, as \nwell as cross -cultural studies, suggest \u2014then there is room for some \noptimism. We are surrounded by recent fundamental changes i n \nsociety. In the last two centuries, abject slavery, with us for thousands \nof years or more, has been almost eliminated in  \na stirring planet -wide revolution. Women, patronized for millennia, \ntraditionally denied real political and economic power, are gradually \nbecoming, even in the most backward societies, equal partners with \nmen. For the first time in modern history, major wa rs of aggression \nwere stopped partly because of the revulsion felt by the citizens of the \naggressor nations. The old exhortations to nationalist fervor and \njingoist pride have begun to lose their appeal. Perhaps because of \nrising standards of living, child ren are being treated better worldwide. \nIn only a few decades, sweeping global changes have begun to move \nin precisely the directions needed for human survival. A new \nconsciousness is developing which recognizes that we are one species.  \n\u201cSuperstition [is] cowardice in the face of the Divine,\u201d wrote  \nTheophrastus, who lived during the founding of the Library of \nAlexandria. We inhabit a universe where atoms are made in the \ncenters of stars; where each second a thousand suns are born;  \nwhere life is sparked by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters \nof youthful planets; where the raw material for biological evolution is \nsometimes made by the explosion of a star halfway across the Milky \nWay; where a thing as beautiful as a galaxy is  formed a hundred billion \ntimes \u2014a Cosmos of quasars and quarks, snowflakes and fireflies, \nwhere there may be black holes and other universes and \nextraterrestrial civilizations whose radio messages are at this moment \nreaching the Earth. How pallid by compar ison are the pretensions of \nsuperstition and pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue \nand understand science, that  \ncharacteristically human endeavor.   \nEvery aspect of Nature reveals a deep mystery and touches our sense \nof wonder and awe. Theophrastus was right. Those afraid of the \nuniverse as it really is, those who pretend to nonexistent knowledge \nand envision a Cosmos centered on human beings will pref er the \nfleeting comforts of superstition. They avoid   \nWho Speaks for Earth? \u2014 333 \nA reconstruction of the armaria of the  \nGreat Library of Alexandria. At its peak, it \ncontained more than half a million vol-  \numes, almost all of which have been \nirrevocably lost.  \nrather than confront the world. But those with the courage to explore the \nweave and structure of the Cosmos, even where it differs profoundly from \ntheir wishes and prejudices, will pene-  \ntrate its deepest mysteries.  \nThere is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, \nentirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the \ncerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can \nbe misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self -\ncorrecting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: \nthere are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; \narguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is \ninconsistent with the f acts must be discarded or revised. We must \nunderstand the Cosmos as it is and not confuse how it is with how we \nwish it to be. The obvious is sometimes false; the unexpected is \nsometimes true. Humans everywhere share the same goals when the \ncontext is larg e enough. And the study of the Cosmos provides the \nlargest possible context. Present global culture is a kind of arrogant \nnewcomer. It arrives on the planetary stage following four and a half \nbillion years of other acts, and after looking about for a few t housand \nyears declares itself in possession of eternal truths. But in a world that \nis changing as fast as ours, this is a prescription for disaster. No nation, \nno religion, no economic system, no body of  \nknowledge, is likely to have all the answers for our survival. There \nmust be many social systems that would work far better than any now \nin existence. In the scientific tradition, our task is to find them.  \nOnly once before in our history was there the promise of a brilliant \nscientific civilization. Beneficiary of the Ionian Awakening, it had its \ncitadel at the Library of Alexandria, where 2,000 years ago the best \nminds of antiquity established the foundation s for the systematic \nstudy of mathematics, physics, biology, astronomy, literature, \ngeography and medicine. We build on those  \n \n334 \u2014 Cosmos  \nfoundations still. The Library was constructed and supported by the \nPtolemys, the Greek kings who inherited the Egyptian portion of the \nempire of Alexander the Great. From the time of its creation in the \nthird century B.C. until its destruction seven cen-turies later, it was the \nbrain and heart of the ancient world.  \nAlexandria was the publishing capital of the planet. Of course, \nthere were no printing presses then. Books were expensive; every one \nof them was copied by hand. The Library was the repository of the \nmost accurate copies in the world. The art of critical ed iting was \ninvented there. The Old Testament comes down to us mainly from \nthe Greek translations made in the Alexandrian Library. The Ptolemys \ndevoted much of their enormous wealth to the acquisition of every \nGreek book, as well as works from Africa, Persia , India, Israel and \nother parts of the world. Ptolemy III Euergetes wished to borrow from \nAthens the original manuscripts or official state copies of the great \nancient tragedies of Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides. To the \nAthenians, these were a kind of cultural patrimony \u2014something like \nthe original handwritten copies and first folios of Shakespeare might \nbe in England. They were reluctant to let the manuscripts out of their \nhands even for a moment. Only after Ptolemy guaranteed their return \nwith an enorm ous cash deposit did they agree to lend the plays. But \nPtolemy valued those scrolls more than gold or silver. He forfeited the \ndeposit gladly and enshrined, as well he might, the originals in the \nLibrary. The outraged Athenians had to content themselves wi th the \ncopies that Ptolemy, only a little shamefacedly, presented to them. \nRarely has a state so avidly supported the pursuit of knowledge.  \nThe Ptolemys did not merely collect established knowledge; they \nencouraged and financed scientific research and so generated new \nknowledge. The results were amazing: Eratosthenes accurately \ncalculated the size of the Earth, mapped it, and argued that India  \ncould be reached by sailing westward from Spain. Hipparchus \nanticipated that stars come into being, slowly move during the course \nof centuries, and eventually perish; it was he who first catalogued the \npositions and magnitudes of the stars to detect such changes. Euclid \nproduced a textbook on geometry from which humans learned for \ntwenty -three centuries, a work that was to help awaken the scientific \ninterest of Kepler, Newton and Einstein. Galen wrote basic works on \nhealing and anatomy which dominated medi cine until the \nRenaissance. There were, as we have noted, many others.  \nAlexandria was the greatest city the Western world had ever seen. \nPeople of all nations came there to live, to trade, to learn. On any \ngiven day, its harbors were thronged with merchants, scholars and \ntourists. This was a city where Greeks, Egyptians, Arab s, Syrians, \nHebrews, Persians, Nubians, Phoenicians, Italians, Gauls and Iberians \nexchanged merchandise and ideas. It is probably here that the word \ncosmopolitan  realized its true meaning \u2014   \nWho Speaks for Earth? \u2014 335 \ncitizen, not just of a nation, but of the Cosmos.* To be a  \ncitizen of the Cosmos . . .  \nHere clearly were the seeds of the modern world. What prevented \nthem from taking root and flourishing? Why instead did the West \nslumber through a thousand years of darkness until Columbus and \nCopernicus and their contemporaries rediscovered the work done i n \nAlexandria? 1 cannot give you a simple answer. But 1 do know this: \nthere is no record, in the entire history of the Library, that any of its \nillustrious scientists and scholars ever seriously challenged the \npolitical, economic and religious assumptions o f their society. The \npermanence of the stars was questioned; the justice of slavery was not. \nScience and learning in general were the preserve of a privileged few. \nThe vast population of the city had not the vaguest notion of the great \ndiscoveries taking p lace within the Library. New findings were not \nexplained or popularized. The research benefited them little. \nDiscoveries in mechanics and steam technology were applied mainly \nto the perfection of weapons, the encouragement of superstition, the \namusement of  kings. The scientists never grasped the potential of \n \nmachines to free people.12  The great intellectual achievements of \nantiquity had few immediate practi-  \ncal applications. Science never captured the imagination of the \nmultitude. There was no counterbalance to stagnation, to pessimism, \nto the most abject surrenders to mysticism. When, at long last, the \nmob came to burn the Library down, there was nobody to s top them.  \nThe last scientist who worked in the Library was a mathematician, \nastronomer, physicist and the head of the Neoplatonic school of \nphilosophy \u2014an extraordinary range of accomplishments for any \nindividual in any age. Her name was Hypatia. She was born in \nAlexandria in 370. At a time when women had few options and were \ntreated as property, Hypatia moved freely and unselfconsciously \nthrough traditional male domains. By all accounts she was a great \nbeauty. She had many suitors but rejected all offers of marriage.  The \nAlexandria of Hypatia\u2019s time \u2014by then long under Roman rule \u2014was a \ncity under grave strain. Slavery had sapped classical civilization of its \nvitality. The growing Christian Church was consolidating its power \nand attempting to eradicate pagan influence a nd culture. Hypatia \nstood at the epicenter of these mighty social forces. Cyril, the \nArchbishop of Alexandria, despised her because of her close \nfriendship with the  \n \n* The word cosmopolitan  was first invented by Diogenes, the rationalist \nphilosopher and critic of Plato.  \nA time line of some of the people, machines and events described in this \nbook.

In great personal danger, she continued to teach and \npublish, until, in the year 415, on her way to work she was set upon  \nby a fanatical mob of Cyril\u2019s parishioners. They dragged her from her \nchariot, tore off her clothes, and, armed with abalone shells, flayed her \nflesh from her bones. Her remains were burned, her works obliterated, \nher name forgotten. Cyril was made a sain t. \nThe glory of the Alexandrian Library is a dim memory. Its last \nremnants were destroyed soon after Hypatia\u2019s death. It was as if the \nentire civilization had undergone some self -inflicted brain surgery, and \nmost of its memories, discoveries, ideas and passio ns were \nextinguished irrevocably. The loss was incalculable. In some cases, we \nknow only the tantalizing titles of the works that were destroyed. In \nmost cases, we know neither the titles nor the authors. We do know \nthat of the 123 plays of Sophocles in th e Library, only seven survived. \nOne of those seven is Oedipus Rex.  Similar numbers apply to the \nworks of Aeschylus and Euripides.  \nIt is a little as if the only surviving works of a man named William \nShakespeare were Coriolanus  and A Winter\u2019s Tale , but we had heard \nthat he had written certain other plays, unknown  \nto us but apparently prized in his time, works entitled Hamlet , Macbeth , \nJulius Caesar , King Lear , Romeo and Juliet . \nOf the physical contents of that glorious Library not a single scroll \nremains. In modern Alexandria few people have a keen appreciation, \nmuch less a detailed knowledge, of the Alexandrian Library or of the \ngreat Egyptian civilization that preceded it for t housands of years. \nMore recent events, other cultural imperatives have taken precedence. \nThe same is true all over the world. We have only the most tenuous \ncontact with our past. And yet just a stone\u2019s throw from the remains \nof the Serapaeum are reminders of many civilizations: enigmatic \nsphinxes from pharaonic Egypt; a great column erected to the Roman \nEmperor Diocletian by a provincial flunky for not altogether \npermitting the citizens of Alexandria to starve to death; a Christian \nchurch; many minarets; an d the hallmarks of modern industrial \ncivilization \u2014apartment houses, automobiles, streetcars, urban slums, \na microwave relay tower. There are a million threads from the past \nintertwined to make the ropes and cables of the modern world.  \nOur achievements rest on the accomplishments of 40,000 \ngenerations of our human predecessors, all but a tiny fraction of whom \nare nameless and forgotten. Every now and then we stumble on a \nmajor civilization, such as the ancient culture of Ebla, which  \nflourished only a few millennia ago and about which we knew \nnothing. How ignorant we are of our own past! Inscrip-  \ntions, papyruses, books time -bind the human species and permit us to \nhear those few voices and faint cries of our brothers and   \nWho Speaks for Earth ? \u2014 337 \nsisters, our ancestors. And what a joy of recognition when we realize how like \nus they were!  \nWe have in this book devoted attention to some of our ancestors \nwhose names have not been lost: Eratosthenes, Democritus, \nAristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo, Kepler, Newton, Huygens, \nChampollion, Humason, Goddard, Einstein \u2014all from Western \nculture because the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is \nmainly a Western civilization; but every culture \u2014China, India, West \nAfrica, Mesoamerica \u2014has made its major contributions to our global \nsociety and had its seminal thinkers. Through technological advances \nin communication our planet is in the final stages of being bound up \nat a breakneck pace into a single global society. If we can accomplish \nthe integration of the Earth without obliterating cultural differences \nor destroying ourselves, we will have accomplis hed a great thing.  \nNear the site of the Alexandrian Library there is today a headless \nsphinx sculpted in the time of the pharoah Horemheb, in the \nEighteenth Dynasty, a millennium before Alexander. Within easy \nview of that leonine body is a modern microwave relay tower. Betwe en \nthem runs an unbroken thread in the history of the human species. \nFrom sphinx to tower is an instant of cosmic time \u2014a moment in the \nfifteen or so billion years that have elapsed since the Big Bang. Almost \nall record of the passage of the universe from t hen to now has been \nscattered by the winds of time. The evidence of cosmic evolution has \nbeen more thoroughly ravaged than all the papyrus scrolls in the \nAlexandrian Library. And yet through daring and intelligence we have \nstolen a few glimpses of that win ding path along which our ancestors \nand we have traveled:  \nFor unknown ages after the explosive outpouring of matter and \nenergy of the Big Bang, the Cosmos was without form. There were no \ngalaxies, no planets, no life. Deep, impenetrable darkness was \neverywhere, hydrogen atoms in the void. Here and there denser \naccumulations of gas were imperceptibly growing, globes of matter \nwere condensing \u2014hydrogen raindrops more massive than suns. \nWithin these globes of gas was first kindled the nuclear fire latent in \nmatter. A first generation of stars was born, flooding the Co smos with \nlight. There were in those times not yet any planets to receive the light, \nno living creatures to admire the radiance of the heavens. Deep in the \nstellar furnaces the alchemy of nuclear fusion created heavy elements, \nthe ashes of hydrogen burning , the atomic building materials of future \nplanets and lifeforms. Massive stars soon exhausted their stores of \nnuclear fuel. Rocked by colossal explosions, they returned most of \ntheir substance back into the thin gas from which they had once  \ncondensed. Here in the dark lush clouds between the stars, new \nraindrops made of many elements were forming, later generations of \nstars being born. Nearby, smaller raindrops grew, bodies far too little \nto ignite the nuclear fire, droplets in the  576 \u2014 Cosmos  \ninterstellar mist on their way to form the planets. Among them was a \nsmall world of stone and iron, the early Earth.  \nCongealing and warming, the Earth released the methane, \nammonia, water and hydrogen gases that had been trapped within, \nforming the primitive atmosphere and the first oceans. Starlight from \nthe Sun bathed and warmed the primeval Earth, drove storms, \ngenera ted lightning and thunder. Volcanoes overflowed with lava. \nThese processes disrupted molecules of the primitive atmosphere; the \nfragments fell back together again into more and more complex forms, \nwhich dissolved in the early oceans. After a time the seas achieved the \nconsistency of a warm, dilute soup. Molecules were organized, and \ncomplex chemical reactions driven, on the surface of clays. And one \nday a molecule arose that quite by accident was able to make crude \ncopies of itself out of the other molecule s in the broth. As time passed, \nmore elaborate and more accurate self -replicating molecules arose. \nThose combinations best suited to further replication were favored by \nthe sieve of natural selection. Those that copied better produced more \ncopies. And the primitive oceanic broth gradually grew thin as it was \nconsumed by and transformed into complex condensations of self -\nreplicating organic molecules. Gradually, imperceptibly, life had \nbegun.  \nSingle -celled plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food. \nPhotosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented. Once \nfree-living forms banded together to make a complex cell with \nspecialized functions. Chemical receptors evolved, and th e Cosmos \ncould taste and smell. One -celled organisms evolved into multicellular \ncolonies, elaborating their various parts into specialized organ systems. \nEyes and ears evolved, and now the Cosmos could see and hear. Plants \nand animals discovered that the l and could support life. Organisms \nbuzzed, crawled, scuttled, lumbered, glided, flapped, shimmied, \nclimbed and soared. Colossal beasts thundered through the steaming \njungles. Small creatures emerged, born live instead of in hard -shelled \ncontainers, with a f luid like the early oceans coursing through their \nveins. They survived by swiftness and cunning. And then, only a \nmoment ago, some small arboreal animals scampered down from the \ntrees. They became upright and taught them-  \nselves the use of tools, domesticated other animals, plants and fire, \nand devised language. The ash of stellar alchemy was now emerging \ninto consciousness. At an ever -accelerating pace, it invented writing, \ncities, art and science, and sent spaceships to t he planets and the stars. \nThese are some of the things that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen \nbillion years of cosmic evolution.  \nIt has the sound of epic myth, and rightly. But it is simply a \ndescription of cosmic evolution as revealed by the science of our time. 577 \u2014 Cosmos  \nWe are difficult to come by and a danger to ourselves. But any account \nof cosmic evolution makes it clear that all the creatures   of   the   \nEarth,   the  latest  manufactures  of  the  galactic  Who Speaks for Earth? \u2014 578 \nhydrogen industry, are beings to be cherished. Elsewhere there may \nbe other equally astonishing transmutations of matter, so wistfully we \nlisten for a humming in the sky.  \nWe have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a \nlittle different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, \nto be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of \nwords like alien  or outlandish.  And yet the monuments and cultures \nof each of our civilizations merely rep-  \nresent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, \nlooking at the differences among human beings and their societies, \nwould find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The \nCosmos may be densely populated with intelligent be ings. But the \nDarwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only \nhere. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered \nspecies. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a \nhuman disagrees with you, let hi m live. In a hundred billion galaxies, \nyou will not find another.  \nHuman history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that \nwe are members of a larger group. Initially our loyalties were to \nourselves and our immediate family, next, to bands of wandering \nhunter -gatherers, then to tribes, small settlements, city - states, nations. \nWe have broadened the circle of those we love. We have now \norganized what are modestly described as superpowers, which include \ngroups of people from divergent ethnic and cultural backgrounds \nworking in some sense together \u2014surely a humanizing a nd character -\nbuilding experience. If we are to survive, our loyalties must be \nbroadened further, to include the whole human community, the \nentire planet Earth. Many of those who run the nations will find this \nidea unpleasant. They will fear the loss of pow er. We will hear much \nabout treason and disloyalty. Rich nation -states will have to share their \nwealth with poor ones. But the choice, as H. G. Wells once said in a \ndifferent context, is clearly the universe or nothing.  \nA few million years ago there were no humans. Who will be here \na few million years hence? In all the 4.6 -billion -year history of our \nplanet, nothing much ever left it. But now, tiny unmanned \nexploratory spacecraft from Earth are moving, glistening and eleg ant, \nthrough the solar system. We have made a preliminary reconnaissance \nof twenty worlds, among them all the planets visible to the naked eye, \nall those wandering nocturnal lights that stirred our ancestors toward \nunderstanding and ecstasy. If we survive,  our time will be famous for \ntwo reasons: that at this dangerous moment of technological \nadolescence we managed to avoid self -destruction; and because this is \nthe epoch in which we began our journey to the stars.  Who Speaks for Earth? \u2014 579 \nThe choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to \nlaunch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to \nthe nations.

If  \nwe continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be \nshaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will rec-  \nognize that our explorations can be carried out only on behalf of all \nthe people of the planet Earth. We will invest our energies in an \nenterprise devoted not to death but to life: the expansion of our \nunderstanding of the Earth and its inhabitants and the  search for life \nelsewhere.

It is almost impos-  \nsible to maintain a static society. There is a kind of psychological \ncompound interest: even a small tendency toward retrenchment, a \nturning away from the Cosmos, adds up over many generations  \nto a significant decline.

To take a modern example, consider the aphorism \nby the great twentieth -century physicist, Niels Bohr: \u201c The opposite of every great idea is another great idea.\u201d If the \nstatement were true, its consequences might be at least  a little perilous. For example, consider the opposite of the \nGolden Rule, or proscriptions against lying or \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d So let us consider whether Bohr\u2019s aphorism \nis itself a great idea. If so, then the converse statement, \u201cThe opposite of ever y great idea is not a great idea,\u201d must \nalso be true. Then we have reached a reductio ad absurdum . If the converse statement is false, the aphorism need \nnot detain us long, since it  \nstands self -confessed as not a great idea.  \nWe present a modern version of the proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2 using a reductio ad absurdum , \nand simple algebra rather than the exclusively geometrical proof discovered by the Pytha-  \ngoreans. The style of argument, the mode of thinking, is at least as interesting as the conclusion:  \n \nConsider a square in which the sides are 1 unit long (1 centimeter, 1 inch, 1 light -year, it does not matter). The \ndiagonal line BC divides the square into two triangles, each containing a right angle. In such right triangles, the \nPythagorean theorem holds: l2 + l2 = x2. But l2 + l2 = 1 + 1 = 2, so x2 = 2 and we write \np /q , or, by multiplying both sides of the equation by q2, we find  \n p2 = 2q2.  (Equation 1)  \np2 is then some number multiplied by 2. Therefore p2 is an even number. But the square of any odd number is \nodd (l2 = 1, 32 = 9, 52 = 25, 72 = 49, etc.). So p itself must be even, and we can write p = 2s, where s is some other \ninteger. Substituting for p in Equation (1), we find p2 = (2s)2 = 4s2 = 2q2  \n \nDividing both sides of the last equality by 2, we find q2 = 2s2 \nTherefore q2 is also an even number, and, by the same argument as we just used for p, it follows that q is even too. \nBut if p and q are both even, both divisible by 2, then they have not been reduced to their lowest common factor, \ncontradicting one of our assumptions.  Reductio ad absurdum . But which assumption? The argument cannot be \ntelling us that reduction to common factors is forbidden, that 14/10 is permitted and 7/5 is not. So the initial \nassumption must be wrong; p and q cannot be whole numbers; and \u221a2 is irrati onal. In fact, \u221a2 = 1.4142135 . . .  \nWhat a stunning and unexpected conclusion! How elegant the proof! But the Pythagoreans felt compelled to \nsuppress this great discovery.   \nAppendix  2  \nThe Five Pythagorean Solids  \nA regular polygon (Greek for \u201cmany -angled\u201d) is a two -dimensional figure with some number, n, of equal sides. \nSo n = 3 is an equilateral triangle, n = 4 is a square, n = 5 is a pentagon, and so on. A polyhedron (Greek for \n\u201cmany -sided\u201d) is a three -dimensiona l figure, all of whose faces are polygons: a cube, for example, with 6 squares \nfor faces. A simple polyhedron, or regular solid, is one with no holes in it. Fundamental to the work of the \nPythagoreans and of Johannes Kepler was the fact that there can be 5  and only 5 regular solids. The easiest proof \ncomes from a relationship discovered much later by Descartes and by Leonhard Euler which relates the number \nof faces, F, the number of edges, E, and the number of corners or vertices V of a regular solid:  \n V \u2014 E + F = 2  (Equation  2)  \nSo for a cube, there are 6 faces (F = 6) and 8 vertices (V = 8), and 8 \u2014 E + 6 = 2, 14 \u2014 E = 2, and E = 12; Equation \n(2) predicts that the cube has 12 edges, as it does. A simple geometric proof of Equation (2) can be found in the \nbook by Courant and Robbi ns in the Bibliography. From Equation (2) we can prove that there are only five regular \nsolids:  \nEvery edge of a regular solid is shared by the sides of two adjacent polygons. Think again of the cube, where \nevery edge is a boundary between two squares. If we count up all the sides of all the faces of a polyhedron, n F, we \nwill have counted every edge twice. So  \n n F = 2 E  (Equation  3)  \nLet r represent how many edges meet at each vertex. For a cube, r = 3. Also, every edge connects two vertices. If \nwe count up all the vertices, r V, we will similarly have counted every edge twice. So  \n r V = 2 E  (Equation 4)  \nSubstituting for V and F in Equation (2) from Equations (3) and (4), we find  \n \nIf we divide both sides of this equation by 2 E, we have  \n  (Equation 5)  \nWe know that n is 3 or more, since the simplest polygon is the triangle, with three sides. We also know that r is 3 \nor more, since at least 3 faces meet at a given vertex in a polyhedron. If both n and r were simultaneously  more \nthan 3, the left -hand side of Equation (5) would be less than \u00b2/ 3 and the equation could not be satisfied for any \npositive value of E. Thus, by another reductio ad absurdum  argument, either  \nn = 3 and r is 3 or more, or r = 3 and n is 3 or more.  \nIf n = 3, Equation (5) becomes (\u00b9/ 3) + (\u00b9/ r) = (\u00b9/ 2) + (\u00b9/ E), or \n  (Equation 6)  \n \nSo in this case r can equal 3, 4, or 5 only. (If E were 6 or more, the equation would be violated.) Now n =  \n3, r = 3 designates a solid in which 3 triangles meet at each vertex. By Equation (6) it has 6 edges; by Equation (3) \nit has 4 faces; by Equation (4) it has 4 vertices. Clearly it is the pyramid or tetrahedron; n = 3, r = 4 is a solid with \n8 faces in which  4 triangles meet at each vertex, the octahedron; and n = 3, r = 5   \nrepresents a solid with 20 faces in which 5 triangles meet at each vertex, the icosahedron (see figures on p. 58).  \nIf r = 3, Equation (5) becomes  \n \nand by similar arguments n can equal 3, 4, or 5 only. n = 3 is the tetrahedron again; n = 4 is a solid whose faces are 6 \nsquares, the cube; and n = 5 corresponds to a solid whose faces are 12 pentagons, the dodecahedron (see figures on p. \n184)- \nThere are no other integer values of n and r possible, and therefore there are only 5 regular solids, a conclusion \nfrom abstract and beautiful mathematics that has had, as we have seen, the most profound impact on practical human \naffair s. \n"
